## AI Prediction Overview

- Market Prediction: 94.50%
- AI Prediction: 90%
- Confidence: 78%
- AI Prediction Delta: 4.50%

### Key Factors
- SEP median for 2025 at 3.6% and range midpoint at 3.65% imply continued easing this year (Sources 1, 2)
- Limited remaining 2025 meetings make a 25 bps October move the smooth path toward SEP targets
- Fed’s preference for 25 bps increments during normalization phases
- Market pricing skewed heavily toward a 25 bps cut after the October meeting
- Rounding rule favors resolution to 25 bps if any small nonzero adjustment occurs
- Counter-risks (hold or 50 bps) less consistent with SEP central tendency and typical communication strategy

### Outcome Reasoning
(1) FOMC projections imply further 2025 easing consistent with incremental 25 bps moves. The September 2025 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) shows the median year-end federal funds rate at 3.6% (midpoint) and the range midpoint at 3.65% for 2025, indicating a materially lower stance by year-end compared with earlier in the cycle [Source 2: FRED FEDTARMD, updated Sep 17, 2025; Source 1: FRED FEDTARRM, updated Sep 17, 2025]. The central tendency high at 4.1% further suggests moderation rather than an unchanged or tighter stance into year-end [Source 4: FRED FEDTARCTH]. This path is most plausibly achieved via 25 bps steps at remaining meetings rather than a pause.

(2) Meeting sequencing favors a 25 bps cut in October. With only two meetings left in 2025 (October 28–29 and December), reaching the SEP-implied year-end level is well-aligned with a gradual cadence (25 bps in October, potentially followed by another 25 bps in December). This is consistent with the Fed’s historical preference for incremental adjustments when inflation is moderating and policy is normalizing (see the FOMC calendar/resolution reference in market description and official policy framework context) [FOMC calendar: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm; Source 5: Fed Economy at a Glance – Policy Rate page for mechanism context].

(3) Market expectations are strongly skewed to a 25 bps cut. The market’s current pricing (YES ~94.5%) reflects aggregated expectations that the October decision will be a 25 bps decrease rather than a hold or a larger move. While not an external data source, this order book consensus complements the SEP trajectory by indicating traders see 25 bps as the modal outcome.

(4) Resolution mechanics slightly favor the 25 bps bracket. The market rules round cuts to the nearest 25 bps (e.g., 12.5 bps would resolve to 25 bps). Although sub-25-bps changes are atypical operationally, this rule eliminates tail ambiguity around fractional adjustments in favor of resolving to 25 bps if any nonzero micro-adjustment were taken.

(5) Counter-scenarios (no change or 50 bps) appear less consistent with the SEP and communication norms. The SEP’s central tendency and median do not point to a need for a larger-than-25 bps move in October, and a pause would require either upside inflation surprises or a desire to bunch cuts into December, both of which run counter to a smooth trajectory toward the 2025 median. The high end of the range (4.4% for 2025) [Source 3: FRED FEDTARRH] shows some participants envision less easing overall, but the median and central tendency dominate as the central outlook.

Note: Source 6 is a general policy page and includes a forward-looking claim about the October 2025 decision that cannot be treated as verified ex ante; it is not relied upon for the prediction.

### Confidence Reasoning
(1) Strong, recent, and authoritative projections support the directional call. The September 17, 2025 SEP data from the Federal Reserve (via FRED) are timely and directly relevant to the policy path, lending credence to expectations of additional 2025 easing [Sources 1, 2, 4]. These are high-reliability, official data.

(2) However, SEPs are year-end projections, not meeting-by-meeting commitments. They do not guarantee an October cut specifically. While a 25 bps October move fits the path to year-end, the FOMC could shift timing (e.g., larger December move or a temporary pause). This limits certainty about the October meeting outcome.

(3) Ancillary sources are weaker or not directly probative. Source 6 contains an apparent premature/incorrect assertion about the October outcome and is not relied upon. The external media search items are outdated (from 2023) and not suitable for precise 2025 meeting calls. Thus, while the core SEP evidence is strong, the breadth of corroborating, up-to-the-minute decision-specific data is limited, leading to MEDIUM data quality and less-than-maximal confidence.

(4) Market pricing strongly favors YES (~94.5%), which supports the prediction but is not itself a primary evidence source. Considering all factors, a 78% confidence appropriately balances strong official projections with residual meeting-timing uncertainty.

Data Quality: MEDIUM

## Market Overview

- Question: Fed decreases interest rates by 25 bps after October 2025 meeting?
- Market: [View on Polymarket](https://polymarket.com/event/27824/fed-decreases-interest-rates-by-25-bps-after-october-2025-meeting)
- Market ID: 553811
- Description: The FED interest rates are defined in this market by the upper bound of the target federal funds range. The decisions on the target federal fund range are made by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings.

This market will resolve to the amount of basis points the upper bound of the target federal funds rate is changed by versus the level it was prior to the Federal Reserve's October 2025 meeting.

If the target federal funds rate is changed to a level not expressed in the displayed options, the change will be rounded up to the nearest 25 and will resolve to the relevant bracket. (e.g. if there's a cut/increase of 12.5 bps it will be considered to be 25 bps)

The resolution source for this market is the FOMC’s statement after its meeting scheduled for October 28 - 29, 2025 according to the official calendar: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.

The level and change of the target federal funds rate is also published at the official website of the Federal Reserve at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm.

This market may resolve as soon as the FOMC’s statement for their October meeting with relevant data is issued. If no statement is released by the end date of the next scheduled meeting, this market will resolve to the "No change" bracket.

These projections are based on assessments of appropriate monetary policy by committee participants and reflect a range of opinions, excluding the highest and lowest forecasts. The next update for these projections is scheduled for December 10, 2025. \n\nIn response to your query about a potential 25 basis point decrease in interest rates after the October 2025 meeting, the current projections suggest that the Fed may maintain or slightly adjust rates rather than implement a significant cut at that time. For more detailed insights, you can refer to the full projections on the [FRED website](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDTARCTH).\n\n### Key Highlights\n- The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. Each participant's projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy.\n- The range for each variable in a given year includes all participants' projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in the given year; the central tendencies exclude the three highest and three lowest projections for each year. This series represents the high value of the central tendency forecast established by the Federal Open Market Committee.Digitized originals of this release can be found at [https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/publication/?pid=677](https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/publication/?pid=677).\n- U.S. Federal Open Market Committee and Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, FOMC Summary of Economic Projections for the Fed Funds Rate, Central Tendency, High \\[FEDTARCTH\\], [Federal Open Market Committee](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/tags/series?t=us.%20federal%20open%20market%20committee) [Federal Open Markets Committee](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/tags/series?t=fomc) [Projection](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/tags/series?t=projection) [Federal](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/tags/series?t=federal) [St. Louis Fed](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/tags/series?t=frb%20stl) [Rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/tags/series?t=rate) [Annual](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/tags/series?t=annual) [Nation](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/tags/series?t=nation) [Public Domain: Citation Requested](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/tags/series?t=public%20domain%3A%20citation%20requested) [Not Seasonally Adjusted](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/tags/series?t=nsa) [United States of America](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/tags/series?t=usa)\n\n### Content\n[Skip to main content](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/fred.stlouisfed.org#content-container)\n\n# FOMC Summary of Economic Projections for the Fed Funds Rate, Central Tendency, High (FEDTARCTH)\n\nObservations\n\n2028: 3.6 \\|\nPercent, Not Seasonally Adjusted \\|\nAnnual\n\nUpdated:\nSep 17, 20252:08 PM CDT\n\n[Next Release Date:\\\nDec 10, 2025](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/releases/calendar?rid=326&y=2025)\n\nObservations\n\n2028:3.6\n\nUpdated:\nSep 17, 20252:08 PM CDT\n\n[Next Release Date:\\\nDec 10, 2025](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/releases/calendar?rid=326&y=2025)\n\n| | |\n| --- | --- |\n| 2028: | 3.6 |\n| 2027: | 3.6 |\n| 2026: | 3.6 |\n| 2025: | 4.1 |\n| [View All](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/data/FEDTARCTH.txt) |\n\nUnits:\n\nPercent,\n\nNot Seasonally Adjusted\n\nFrequency:\n\nAnnual\n\nFullscreen\n\n**Data in this graph are copyrighted.

The FOMC meets regularly to set the target range for the federal funds rate, which influences short-term interest rates and, consequently, economic activity, employment, and inflation. The effective federal funds rate is the interest rate banks charge each other for overnight loans, and the Federal Reserve manages this rate through monetary policy tools. For the latest updates on interest rate decisions, including any changes post-October 2025, refer to the FOMC announcements following their meetings.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Changes in the target range for the federal funds rate influence short-term interest rates for other financial instruments, which in turn affect the spending decisions of households and businesses and thus have implications for economic activity, employment, and inflation. The Federal Reserve steers the federal funds rate into its target range primarily by changing the interest rate paid on reserve balances and the interest rate of its overnight reverse repurchase facility.\n- The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sets a target range for the federal funds rate. The FOMC has eight regularly scheduled meetings each year and announces its policy decisions at 2 p.m. Eastern Time on the second day of each meeting. The FOMC is made up of members of the Board of Governors, who are based in Washington, D.C., and Federal Reserve Bank presidents from around the country.\n- **Secure .gov websites use HTTPS** A **lock** (Locked padlock icon) or **https://** means you've safely connected to the .gov website.

Following the October 2025 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the Fed decreased interest rates by 25 basis points (bps), adjusting the upper bound of the target federal funds range. This decision reflects the Fed's ongoing review of its monetary policy strategy and tools, which is part of its commitment to adapt to changing economic conditions.

The September 2025 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) shows the median year-end federal funds rate at 3.6% (midpoint) and the range midpoint at 3.65% for 2025, indicating a materially lower stance by year-end compared with earlier in the cycle [Source 2: FRED FEDTARMD, updated Sep 17, 2025; Source 1: FRED FEDTARRM, updated Sep 17, 2025]. The central tendency high at 4.1% further suggests moderation rather than an unchanged or tighter stance into year-end [Source 4: FRED FEDTARCTH]. This path is most plausibly achieved via 25 bps steps at remaining meetings rather than a pause.\\n\\n(2) Meeting sequencing favors a 25 bps cut in October. With only two meetings left in 2025 (October 28–29 and December), reaching the SEP-implied year-end level is well-aligned with a gradual cadence (25 bps in October, potentially followed by another 25 bps in December). This is consistent with the Fed’s historical preference for incremental adjustments when inflation is moderating and policy is normalizing (see the FOMC calendar/resolution reference in market description and official policy framework context) [FOMC calendar: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm; Source 5: Fed Economy at a Glance – Policy Rate page for mechanism context].\\n\\n(3) Market expectations are strongly skewed to a 25 bps cut. The market’s current pricing (YES ~94.5%) reflects aggregated expectations that the October decision will be a 25 bps decrease rather than a hold or a larger move. While not an external data source, this order book consensus complements the SEP trajectory by indicating traders see 25 bps as the modal outcome.\\n\\n(4) Resolution mechanics slightly favor the 25 bps bracket. The market rules round cuts to the nearest 25 bps (e.g., 12.5 bps would resolve to 25 bps). Although sub-25-bps changes are atypical operationally, this rule eliminates tail ambiguity around fractional adjustments in favor of resolving to 25 bps if any nonzero micro-adjustment were taken.\\n\\n(5) Counter-scenarios (no change or 50 bps) appear less consistent with the SEP and communication norms. The SEP’s central tendency and median do not point to a need for a larger-than-25 bps move in October, and a pause would require either upside inflation surprises or a desire to bunch cuts into December, both of which run counter to a smooth trajectory toward the 2025 median. The high end of the range (4.4% for 2025) [Source 3: FRED FEDTARRH] shows some participants envision less easing overall, but the median and central tendency dominate as the central outlook.\\n\\nSources cited: \\n- Source 1: FRED FEDTARRM (Range, Midpoint) – 2025: 3.65%, updated Sep 17, 2025.\\n- Source 2: FRED FEDTARMD (Median) – 2025: 3.6%, updated Sep 17, 2025.\\n- Source 4: FRED FEDTARCTH (Central Tendency, High) – 2025: 4.1%, updated Sep 17, 2025.\\n- FOMC calendar (resolution reference): https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\\nNote: Source 6 is a general policy page and includes a forward-looking claim about the October 2025 decision that cannot be treated as verified ex ante; it is not relied upon for the prediction.\",\n    \"confidence\": 78,\n    \"confidenceReasoning\": \"(1) Strong, recent, and authoritative projections support the directional call. The September 17, 2025 SEP data from the Federal Reserve (via FRED) are timely and directly relevant to the policy path, lending credence to expectations of additional 2025 easing [Sources 1, 2, 4]. These are high-reliability, official data.\\n\\n(2) However, SEPs are year-end projections, not meeting-by-meeting commitments. They do not guarantee an October cut specifically. While a 25 bps October move fits the path to year-end, the FOMC could shift timing (e.g., larger December move or a temporary pause). This limits certainty about the October meeting outcome.\\n\\n(3) Ancillary sources are weaker or not directly probative. Source 6 contains an apparent premature/incorrect assertion about the October outcome and is not relied upon. The external media search items are outdated (from 2023) and not suitable for precise 2025 meeting calls. Thus, while the core SEP evidence is strong, the breadth of corroborating, up-to-the-minute decision-specific data is limited, leading to MEDIUM data quality and less-than-maximal confidence.\\n\\n(4) Market pricing strongly favors YES (~94.5%), which supports the prediction but is not itself a primary evidence source.

        "reasoning": "**Analyzing interest rate predictions**\n\nI need to analyze a Polymarket market regarding whether the Fed will decrease interest rates by 25 basis points after the October 2025 meeting. The market will resolve based on the upper bound change on October 28-29, 2025, compared to the level before the meeting. The options \"YES\" or \"NO\" specifically refer to a decrease of exactly 25 bps. Usually, Polymarket has multiple brackets for changes, but this one has a separate yes/no for just the 25 bps decrease. So I’ll assume \"YES\" means the target is lowered by that amount.**Examining interest rate cut details**\n\nI’m considering how changes that aren’t exactly expressed in options get rounded to the nearest 25 basis points—for instance, a 12.5 bps cut would be treated as a 25 bps decrease. However, it’s unusual for the Fed to cut by 12.5; typical cuts are 25 or 50 bps. As of October 17, 2025, I need to determine the current federal funds target range upper bound. I have some research data from FRED showing median values and ranges for 2025, but it’s unclear what the current target is.**Analyzing interest rate information**\n\nI’m looking at an \"Economy at a Glance - Policy Rate\" page, but it doesn't show any numbers. There's a claim that after the October 2025 FOMC meeting, the Fed will decrease interest rates by 25 bps. However, wait, that seems inaccurate since it’s before the meeting date. This might be a mistake or an error from the web data. I also found Grok Web Search results from 2023, which are outdated for the October 2025 context. Right now, the market shows a 94.5% probability for the 25 bps decrease, but I need to rely on research sources.**Evaluating interest rate changes**\n\nI’m reasoning through the SEP median for end-2025, which is 3.6%. I need to establish the starting point; in 2024, the Fed's upper bound was 5.5%. By late 2024, they likely began cutting rates. If they've made cuts, the SEP median suggests a midpoint around 3.625%, which probably corresponds to a range of 3.5-3.75%. To reach this midpoint, total cuts would need to be around 175-200 bps. As of September 17, 2025, they had likely already cut several times, and predictions suggest a 25 bps cut in October.**Structuring interest rate prediction**\n\nI need to organize my reasoning for predicting the Fed’s rate cut in a structured manner. Official sources include FRED SEP data and the Fed calendar; I’ll focus on reliable information since older forecasts are less valuable now. The probability from market prices indicates a 94.5% chance of a 25 bps cut, but I should estimate a slightly conservative 85-92%. \n\nKey points will include:\n\n1. The SEP median suggests further cuts are needed to reach a midpoint of 3.6% by year-end.  \n2. Market pricing strongly supports a 25 bps decrease.  \n3. The Fed usually cuts in 25 bps increments, which aligns with current inflation trends.  \n4. Historical data indicates a significant cut would be plausible, paving the way for another change in December.\n\nI’ll also assess the quality of data, affirming that while some sources seem unreliable, official SEP data is robust.

            "summary": "**Analyzing interest rate predictions**\n\nI need to analyze a Polymarket market regarding whether the Fed will decrease interest rates by 25 basis points after the October 2025 meeting. The market will resolve based on the upper bound change on October 28-29, 2025, compared to the level before the meeting. The options \"YES\" or \"NO\" specifically refer to a decrease of exactly 25 bps. Usually, Polymarket has multiple brackets for changes, but this one has a separate yes/no for just the 25 bps decrease. So I’ll assume \"YES\" means the target is lowered by that amount.**Examining interest rate cut details**\n\nI’m considering how changes that aren’t exactly expressed in options get rounded to the nearest 25 basis points—for instance, a 12.5 bps cut would be treated as a 25 bps decrease. However, it’s unusual for the Fed to cut by 12.5; typical cuts are 25 or 50 bps. As of October 17, 2025, I need to determine the current federal funds target range upper bound. I have some research data from FRED showing median values and ranges for 2025, but it’s unclear what the current target is.**Analyzing interest rate information**\n\nI’m looking at an \"Economy at a Glance - Policy Rate\" page, but it doesn't show any numbers. There's a claim that after the October 2025 FOMC meeting, the Fed will decrease interest rates by 25 bps. However, wait, that seems inaccurate since it’s before the meeting date. This might be a mistake or an error from the web data. I also found Grok Web Search results from 2023, which are outdated for the October 2025 context. Right now, the market shows a 94.5% probability for the 25 bps decrease, but I need to rely on research sources.**Evaluating interest rate changes**\n\nI’m reasoning through the SEP median for end-2025, which is 3.6%. I need to establish the starting point; in 2024, the Fed's upper bound was 5.5%. By late 2024, they likely began cutting rates. If they've made cuts, the SEP median suggests a midpoint around 3.625%, which probably corresponds to a range of 3.5-3.75%. To reach this midpoint, total cuts would need to be around 175-200 bps. As of September 17, 2025, they had likely already cut several times, and predictions suggest a 25 bps cut in October.**Structuring interest rate prediction**\n\nI need to organize my reasoning for predicting the Fed’s rate cut in a structured manner. Official sources include FRED SEP data and the Fed calendar; I’ll focus on reliable information since older forecasts are less valuable now. The probability from market prices indicates a 94.5% chance of a 25 bps cut, but I should estimate a slightly conservative 85-92%. \n\nKey points will include:\n\n1. The SEP median suggests further cuts are needed to reach a midpoint of 3.6% by year-end.  \n2. Market pricing strongly supports a 25 bps decrease.  \n3. The Fed usually cuts in 25 bps increments, which aligns with current inflation trends.  \n4. Historical data indicates a significant cut would be plausible, paving the way for another change in December.\n\nI’ll also assess the quality of data, affirming that while some sources seem unreliable, official SEP data is robust.

    "question": "Fed decreases interest rates by 25 bps after October 2025 meeting?",
    "prediction": {
      "outcome": "YES",
      "outcomeReasoning": "(1) FOMC projections imply further 2025 easing consistent with incremental 25 bps moves. The September 2025 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) shows the median year-end federal funds rate at 3.6% (midpoint) and the range midpoint at 3.65% for 2025, indicating a materially lower stance by year-end compared with earlier in the cycle [Source 2: FRED FEDTARMD, updated Sep 17, 2025; Source 1: FRED FEDTARRM, updated Sep 17, 2025]. The central tendency high at 4.1% further suggests moderation rather than an unchanged or tighter stance into year-end [Source 4: FRED FEDTARCTH]. This path is most plausibly achieved via 25 bps steps at remaining meetings rather than a pause.\n\n(2) Meeting sequencing favors a 25 bps cut in October. With only two meetings left in 2025 (October 28–29 and December), reaching the SEP-implied year-end level is well-aligned with a gradual cadence (25 bps in October, potentially followed by another 25 bps in December). This is consistent with the Fed’s historical preference for incremental adjustments when inflation is moderating and policy is normalizing (see the FOMC calendar/resolution reference in market description and official policy framework context) [FOMC calendar: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm; Source 5: Fed Economy at a Glance – Policy Rate page for mechanism context].\n\n(3) Market expectations are strongly skewed to a 25 bps cut. The market’s current pricing (YES ~94.5%) reflects aggregated expectations that the October decision will be a 25 bps decrease rather than a hold or a larger move. While not an external data source, this order book consensus complements the SEP trajectory by indicating traders see 25 bps as the modal outcome.\n\n(4) Resolution mechanics slightly favor the 25 bps bracket. The market rules round cuts to the nearest 25 bps (e.g., 12.5 bps would resolve to 25 bps). Although sub-25-bps changes are atypical operationally, this rule eliminates tail ambiguity around fractional adjustments in favor of resolving to 25 bps if any nonzero micro-adjustment were taken.\n\n(5) Counter-scenarios (no change or 50 bps) appear less consistent with the SEP and communication norms. The SEP’s central tendency and median do not point to a need for a larger-than-25 bps move in October, and a pause would require either upside inflation surprises or a desire to bunch cuts into December, both of which run counter to a smooth trajectory toward the 2025 median. The high end of the range (4.4% for 2025) [Source 3: FRED FEDTARRH] shows some participants envision less easing overall, but the median and central tendency dominate as the central outlook.\n\nSources cited: \n- Source 1: FRED FEDTARRM (Range, Midpoint) – 2025: 3.65%, updated Sep 17, 2025.\n- Source 2: FRED FEDTARMD (Median) – 2025: 3.6%, updated Sep 17, 2025.\n- Source 4: FRED FEDTARCTH (Central Tendency, High) – 2025: 4.1%, updated Sep 17, 2025.\n- FOMC calendar (resolution reference): https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\nNote: Source 6 is a general policy page and includes a forward-looking claim about the October 2025 decision that cannot be treated as verified ex ante; it is not relied upon for the prediction.",
      "confidence": 78,
      "confidenceReasoning": "(1) Strong, recent, and authoritative projections support the directional call. The September 17, 2025 SEP data from the Federal Reserve (via FRED) are timely and directly relevant to the policy path, lending credence to expectations of additional 2025 easing [Sources 1, 2, 4]. These are high-reliability, official data.\n\n(2) However, SEPs are year-end projections, not meeting-by-meeting commitments. They do not guarantee an October cut specifically. While a 25 bps October move fits the path to year-end, the FOMC could shift timing (e.g., larger December move or a temporary pause). This limits certainty about the October meeting outcome.\n\n(3) Ancillary sources are weaker or not directly probative. Source 6 contains an apparent premature/incorrect assertion about the October outcome and is not relied upon. The external media search items are outdated (from 2023) and not suitable for precise 2025 meeting calls. Thus, while the core SEP evidence is strong, the breadth of corroborating, up-to-the-minute decision-specific data is limited, leading to MEDIUM data quality and less-than-maximal confidence.\n\n(4) Market pricing strongly favors YES (~94.5%), which supports the prediction but is not itself a primary evidence source. Considering all factors, a 78% confidence appropriately balances strong official projections with residual meeting-timing uncertainty.",

The decisions on the target federal fund range are made by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings.\n\nThis market will resolve to the amount of basis points the upper bound of the target federal funds rate is changed by versus the level it was prior to the Federal Reserve's October 2025 meeting.\n\nIf the target federal funds rate is changed to a level not expressed in the displayed options, the change will be rounded up to the nearest 25 and will resolve to the relevant bracket. (e.g. if there's a cut/increase of 12.5 bps it will be considered to be 25 bps)\n\nThe resolution source for this market is the FOMC’s statement after its meeting scheduled for October 28 - 29, 2025 according to the official calendar: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\nThe level and change of the target federal funds rate is also published at the official website of the Federal Reserve at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm.\n\nThis market may resolve as soon as the FOMC’s statement for their October meeting with relevant data is issued. If no statement is released by the end date of the next scheduled meeting, this market will resolve to the \"No change\" bracket.\n\n## Market Details\n- Market ID: 553811\n- Condition ID: 0x53f82bd52566e30ae3f8131cb92095dd92ecdf2b0204af0edc226ee194e923fe\n- Active: Yes\n- Closed: No\n- Current Volume: 12550881.751183\n- Current Liquidity: 469526.2173\n- Current Outcome Prices: YES: 94.5%, NO: 5.5%\n\n---\n\n# Web Research Data\n\nThe following information was gathered from web research to provide context for this prediction:\n\n## Source 1: FOMC Summary of Economic Projections for the Fed Funds Rate, Range, Midpoint\nURL: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDTARRM\nPublished: 2025-06-18T00:00:00.000Z\n\n### Summary\nThis webpage provides data on the FOMC Summary of Economic Projections for the Fed Funds Rate, Range, Midpoint (FEDTARRM).

The FOMC meets regularly to set the target range for the federal funds rate, which influences short-term interest rates and, consequently, economic activity, employment, and inflation. The effective federal funds rate is the interest rate banks charge each other for overnight loans, and the Federal Reserve manages this rate through monetary policy tools. For the latest updates on interest rate decisions, including any changes post-October 2025, refer to the FOMC announcements following their meetings.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Changes in the target range for the federal funds rate influence short-term interest rates for other financial instruments, which in turn affect the spending decisions of households and businesses and thus have implications for economic activity, employment, and inflation. The Federal Reserve steers the federal funds rate into its target range primarily by changing the interest rate paid on reserve balances and the interest rate of its overnight reverse repurchase facility.\n- The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sets a target range for the federal funds rate. The FOMC has eight regularly scheduled meetings each year and announces its policy decisions at 2 p.m. Eastern Time on the second day of each meeting. The FOMC is made up of members of the Board of Governors, who are based in Washington, D.C., and Federal Reserve Bank presidents from around the country.\n- **Secure .gov websites use HTTPS** A **lock** (Locked padlock icon) or **https://** means you've safely connected to the .gov website.

Following the October 2025 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the Fed decreased interest rates by 25 basis points (bps), adjusting the upper bound of the target federal funds range. This decision reflects the Fed's ongoing review of its monetary policy strategy and tools, which is part of its commitment to adapt to changing economic conditions.

The September 2025 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) shows the median year-end federal funds rate at 3.6% (midpoint) and the range midpoint at 3.65% for 2025, indicating a materially lower stance by year-end compared with earlier in the cycle [Source 2: FRED FEDTARMD, updated Sep 17, 2025; Source 1: FRED FEDTARRM, updated Sep 17, 2025]. The central tendency high at 4.1% further suggests moderation rather than an unchanged or tighter stance into year-end [Source 4: FRED FEDTARCTH]. This path is most plausibly achieved via 25 bps steps at remaining meetings rather than a pause.\\n\\n(2) Meeting sequencing favors a 25 bps cut in October. With only two meetings left in 2025 (October 28–29 and December), reaching the SEP-implied year-end level is well-aligned with a gradual cadence (25 bps in October, potentially followed by another 25 bps in December). This is consistent with the Fed’s historical preference for incremental adjustments when inflation is moderating and policy is normalizing (see the FOMC calendar/resolution reference in market description and official policy framework context) [FOMC calendar: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm; Source 5: Fed Economy at a Glance – Policy Rate page for mechanism context].\\n\\n(3) Market expectations are strongly skewed to a 25 bps cut. The market’s current pricing (YES ~94.5%) reflects aggregated expectations that the October decision will be a 25 bps decrease rather than a hold or a larger move. While not an external data source, this order book consensus complements the SEP trajectory by indicating traders see 25 bps as the modal outcome.\\n\\n(4) Resolution mechanics slightly favor the 25 bps bracket. The market rules round cuts to the nearest 25 bps (e.g., 12.5 bps would resolve to 25 bps). Although sub-25-bps changes are atypical operationally, this rule eliminates tail ambiguity around fractional adjustments in favor of resolving to 25 bps if any nonzero micro-adjustment were taken.\\n\\n(5) Counter-scenarios (no change or 50 bps) appear less consistent with the SEP and communication norms. The SEP’s central tendency and median do not point to a need for a larger-than-25 bps move in October, and a pause would require either upside inflation surprises or a desire to bunch cuts into December, both of which run counter to a smooth trajectory toward the 2025 median. The high end of the range (4.4% for 2025) [Source 3: FRED FEDTARRH] shows some participants envision less easing overall, but the median and central tendency dominate as the central outlook.\\n\\nSources cited: \\n- Source 1: FRED FEDTARRM (Range, Midpoint) – 2025: 3.65%, updated Sep 17, 2025.\\n- Source 2: FRED FEDTARMD (Median) – 2025: 3.6%, updated Sep 17, 2025.\\n- Source 4: FRED FEDTARCTH (Central Tendency, High) – 2025: 4.1%, updated Sep 17, 2025.\\n- FOMC calendar (resolution reference): https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\\nNote: Source 6 is a general policy page and includes a forward-looking claim about the October 2025 decision that cannot be treated as verified ex ante; it is not relied upon for the prediction.\",\n    \"confidence\": 78,\n    \"confidenceReasoning\": \"(1) Strong, recent, and authoritative projections support the directional call. The September 17, 2025 SEP data from the Federal Reserve (via FRED) are timely and directly relevant to the policy path, lending credence to expectations of additional 2025 easing [Sources 1, 2, 4]. These are high-reliability, official data.\\n\\n(2) However, SEPs are year-end projections, not meeting-by-meeting commitments. They do not guarantee an October cut specifically. While a 25 bps October move fits the path to year-end, the FOMC could shift timing (e.g., larger December move or a temporary pause). This limits certainty about the October meeting outcome.\\n\\n(3) Ancillary sources are weaker or not directly probative. Source 6 contains an apparent premature/incorrect assertion about the October outcome and is not relied upon. The external media search items are outdated (from 2023) and not suitable for precise 2025 meeting calls. Thus, while the core SEP evidence is strong, the breadth of corroborating, up-to-the-minute decision-specific data is limited, leading to MEDIUM data quality and less-than-maximal confidence.\\n\\n(4) Market pricing strongly favors YES (~94.5%), which supports the prediction but is not itself a primary evidence source.

          "reasoning": "**Analyzing interest rate predictions**\n\nI need to analyze a Polymarket market regarding whether the Fed will decrease interest rates by 25 basis points after the October 2025 meeting. The market will resolve based on the upper bound change on October 28-29, 2025, compared to the level before the meeting. The options \"YES\" or \"NO\" specifically refer to a decrease of exactly 25 bps. Usually, Polymarket has multiple brackets for changes, but this one has a separate yes/no for just the 25 bps decrease. So I’ll assume \"YES\" means the target is lowered by that amount.**Examining interest rate cut details**\n\nI’m considering how changes that aren’t exactly expressed in options get rounded to the nearest 25 basis points—for instance, a 12.5 bps cut would be treated as a 25 bps decrease. However, it’s unusual for the Fed to cut by 12.5; typical cuts are 25 or 50 bps. As of October 17, 2025, I need to determine the current federal funds target range upper bound. I have some research data from FRED showing median values and ranges for 2025, but it’s unclear what the current target is.**Analyzing interest rate information**\n\nI’m looking at an \"Economy at a Glance - Policy Rate\" page, but it doesn't show any numbers. There's a claim that after the October 2025 FOMC meeting, the Fed will decrease interest rates by 25 bps. However, wait, that seems inaccurate since it’s before the meeting date. This might be a mistake or an error from the web data. I also found Grok Web Search results from 2023, which are outdated for the October 2025 context. Right now, the market shows a 94.5% probability for the 25 bps decrease, but I need to rely on research sources.**Evaluating interest rate changes**\n\nI’m reasoning through the SEP median for end-2025, which is 3.6%. I need to establish the starting point; in 2024, the Fed's upper bound was 5.5%. By late 2024, they likely began cutting rates. If they've made cuts, the SEP median suggests a midpoint around 3.625%, which probably corresponds to a range of 3.5-3.75%. To reach this midpoint, total cuts would need to be around 175-200 bps. As of September 17, 2025, they had likely already cut several times, and predictions suggest a 25 bps cut in October.**Structuring interest rate prediction**\n\nI need to organize my reasoning for predicting the Fed’s rate cut in a structured manner. Official sources include FRED SEP data and the Fed calendar; I’ll focus on reliable information since older forecasts are less valuable now. The probability from market prices indicates a 94.5% chance of a 25 bps cut, but I should estimate a slightly conservative 85-92%. \n\nKey points will include:\n\n1. The SEP median suggests further cuts are needed to reach a midpoint of 3.6% by year-end.  \n2. Market pricing strongly supports a 25 bps decrease.  \n3. The Fed usually cuts in 25 bps increments, which aligns with current inflation trends.  \n4. Historical data indicates a significant cut would be plausible, paving the way for another change in December.\n\nI’ll also assess the quality of data, affirming that while some sources seem unreliable, official SEP data is robust. Finally, I’ll set the last updated timestamp to 2025-10-17T00:00:00Z.**Finalizing prediction reasoning**\n\nI need to clarify some key points for our prediction about the Fed's rate change. If they consider a 12.5 bps cut, it rounds up to 25 bps, which increases the likelihood of a \"YES\" outcome. However, it’s very unlikely they would cut by 12.5.

              "summary": "**Analyzing interest rate predictions**\n\nI need to analyze a Polymarket market regarding whether the Fed will decrease interest rates by 25 basis points after the October 2025 meeting. The market will resolve based on the upper bound change on October 28-29, 2025, compared to the level before the meeting. The options \"YES\" or \"NO\" specifically refer to a decrease of exactly 25 bps. Usually, Polymarket has multiple brackets for changes, but this one has a separate yes/no for just the 25 bps decrease. So I’ll assume \"YES\" means the target is lowered by that amount.**Examining interest rate cut details**\n\nI’m considering how changes that aren’t exactly expressed in options get rounded to the nearest 25 basis points—for instance, a 12.5 bps cut would be treated as a 25 bps decrease. However, it’s unusual for the Fed to cut by 12.5; typical cuts are 25 or 50 bps. As of October 17, 2025, I need to determine the current federal funds target range upper bound. I have some research data from FRED showing median values and ranges for 2025, but it’s unclear what the current target is.**Analyzing interest rate information**\n\nI’m looking at an \"Economy at a Glance - Policy Rate\" page, but it doesn't show any numbers. There's a claim that after the October 2025 FOMC meeting, the Fed will decrease interest rates by 25 bps. However, wait, that seems inaccurate since it’s before the meeting date. This might be a mistake or an error from the web data. I also found Grok Web Search results from 2023, which are outdated for the October 2025 context. Right now, the market shows a 94.5% probability for the 25 bps decrease, but I need to rely on research sources.**Evaluating interest rate changes**\n\nI’m reasoning through the SEP median for end-2025, which is 3.6%. I need to establish the starting point; in 2024, the Fed's upper bound was 5.5%. By late 2024, they likely began cutting rates. If they've made cuts, the SEP median suggests a midpoint around 3.625%, which probably corresponds to a range of 3.5-3.75%. To reach this midpoint, total cuts would need to be around 175-200 bps. As of September 17, 2025, they had likely already cut several times, and predictions suggest a 25 bps cut in October.**Structuring interest rate prediction**\n\nI need to organize my reasoning for predicting the Fed’s rate cut in a structured manner. Official sources include FRED SEP data and the Fed calendar; I’ll focus on reliable information since older forecasts are less valuable now. The probability from market prices indicates a 94.5% chance of a 25 bps cut, but I should estimate a slightly conservative 85-92%. \n\nKey points will include:\n\n1. The SEP median suggests further cuts are needed to reach a midpoint of 3.6% by year-end.  \n2. Market pricing strongly supports a 25 bps decrease.  \n3. The Fed usually cuts in 25 bps increments, which aligns with current inflation trends.  \n4. Historical data indicates a significant cut would be plausible, paving the way for another change in December.\n\nI’ll also assess the quality of data, affirming that while some sources seem unreliable, official SEP data is robust. Finally, I’ll set the last updated timestamp to 2025-10-17T00:00:00Z.**Finalizing prediction reasoning**\n\nI need to clarify some key points for our prediction about the Fed's rate change. If they consider a 12.5 bps cut, it rounds up to 25 bps, which increases the likelihood of a \"YES\" outcome. However, it’s very unlikely they would cut by 12.5. If there's no statement released by the meeting's end, it defaults to \"No change,\" but that's not relevant here since a statement is always made.\n\nFor the prediction:\n- **Outcome:** YES\n- **Probability:** 90\n- **Confidence:** 78\n- **Data Quality:** MEDIUM\n\nI’ll cite relevant sources and outline key factors supporting these predictions while keeping the structure clear. Each argument needs numbering and paragraph breaks for clarity. Finally, the confidence reasoning will reflect the reliability of the SEP data and its limitations.

The latest data, updated September 17, 2025, shows the projected midpoint for the federal funds rate at 3.65% for 2025, 3.25% for 2026, 3.15% for 2027, and 3.25% for 2028. The next release date is December 10, 2025. The projections represent the midpoint of the FOMC's projected target range. This data does not provide information on specific interest rate decreases or decisions made at any particular meeting.\n\n\n### Key Highlights\n- The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. Each participant's projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy.\n- The range for each variable in a given year includes all participants' projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in the given year.

The FOMC meets regularly to set the target range for the federal funds rate, which influences short-term interest rates and, consequently, economic activity, employment, and inflation. The effective federal funds rate is the interest rate banks charge each other for overnight loans, and the Federal Reserve manages this rate through monetary policy tools. For the latest updates on interest rate decisions, including any changes post-October 2025, refer to the FOMC announcements following their meetings.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Changes in the target range for the federal funds rate influence short-term interest rates for other financial instruments, which in turn affect the spending decisions of households and businesses and thus have implications for economic activity, employment, and inflation. The Federal Reserve steers the federal funds rate into its target range primarily by changing the interest rate paid on reserve balances and the interest rate of its overnight reverse repurchase facility.\n- The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sets a target range for the federal funds rate. The FOMC has eight regularly scheduled meetings each year and announces its policy decisions at 2 p.m. Eastern Time on the second day of each meeting. The FOMC is made up of members of the Board of Governors, who are based in Washington, D.C., and Federal Reserve Bank presidents from around the country.\n- **Secure .gov websites use HTTPS** A **lock** (Locked padlock icon) or **https://** means you've safely connected to the .gov website.

Following the October 2025 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the Fed decreased interest rates by 25 basis points (bps), adjusting the upper bound of the target federal funds range. This decision reflects the Fed's ongoing review of its monetary policy strategy and tools, which is part of its commitment to adapt to changing economic conditions.

Recent data shows weakening labor markets and slowing GDP growth, which could prompt the FOMC to adjust policy. Experts from Bloomberg Economics suggest monitoring upcoming inflation reports for more clues.\n\n---\n\n## Result 2: Reuters Analysis: Fed Could Ease Rates by 25 bps in October 2025\nURL: https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-interest-rate-forecast-2025-2023-10-01/\nSource: Reuters\nPublished: 2023-10-01T10:00:00Z\n\nA Reuters poll of economists indicates a high likelihood of a 25 basis point rate cut by the Fed following the October 2025 meeting, driven by persistent global economic uncertainties. Current indicators, such as rising unemployment and controlled inflation, support this prediction.

### Summary
This webpage provides data on the FOMC Summary of Economic Projections for the Fed Funds Rate, Range, Midpoint (FEDTARRM).  The latest data, updated September 17, 2025, shows the projected midpoint for the federal funds rate at 3.65% for 2025, 3.25% for 2026, 3.15% for 2027, and 3.25% for 2028. The next release date is December 10, 2025. The projections represent the midpoint of the FOMC's projected target range. This data does not provide information on specific interest rate decreases or decisions made at any particular meeting.


### Key Highlights
- The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. Each participant's projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy.
- The range for each variable in a given year includes all participants' projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in the given year.

URL: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDTARMD
Published: 2025-06-18T00:00:00.000Z

### Summary
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) projects the federal funds rate to be 3.6% in 2025, decreasing to 3.4% in 2026, and stabilizing at 3.1% for both 2027 and 2028. These projections reflect the median estimates of committee members regarding appropriate monetary policy. The next update on these projections is scheduled for December 10, 2025. 

If you're inquiring about a potential 25 basis point decrease in interest rates following the October 2025 meeting, the current projections suggest a downward trend in rates, but specific decisions will depend on economic conditions and the FOMC's assessments at that time. For further details, you can access the full projections [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDTARMD).

### Key Highlights
- The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. Each participant's projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy.
- When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.Digitized originals of this release can be found at [https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/publication/?pid=677](https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/publication/?pid=677).

## Source 4: FOMC Summary of Economic Projections for the Fed Funds Rate, Central Tendency, High
URL: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDTARCTH
Published: 2025-03-19T00:00:00.000Z

### Summary
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has provided projections for the federal funds rate, indicating a high central tendency forecast of 4.1% for 2025, with a consistent rate of 3.6% projected for 2026 to 2028. These projections are based on assessments of appropriate monetary policy by committee participants and reflect a range of opinions, excluding the highest and lowest forecasts. The next update for these projections is scheduled for December 10, 2025. 

In response to your query about a potential 25 basis point decrease in interest rates after the October 2025 meeting, the current projections suggest that the Fed may maintain or slightly adjust rates rather than implement a significant cut at that time. For more detailed insights, you can refer to the full projections on the [FRED website](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDTARCTH).

### Key Highlights
- The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. Each participant's projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy.
- The range for each variable in a given year includes all participants' projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in the given year; the central tendencies exclude the three highest and three lowest projections for each year.

## Source 5: Economy at a Glance - Policy Rate
URL: https://federalreserve.gov/economy-at-a-glance-policy-rate.htm
Published: 2025-07-30T00:00:00.000Z

### Summary
The Federal Reserve's decision regarding interest rates, including any potential decrease of 25 basis points (bps) after the October 2025 meeting, will be determined by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The FOMC meets regularly to set the target range for the federal funds rate, which influences short-term interest rates and, consequently, economic activity, employment, and inflation. The effective federal funds rate is the interest rate banks charge each other for overnight loans, and the Federal Reserve manages this rate through monetary policy tools. For the latest updates on interest rate decisions, including any changes post-October 2025, refer to the FOMC announcements following their meetings.

### Key Highlights
- Changes in the target range for the federal funds rate influence short-term interest rates for other financial instruments, which in turn affect the spending decisions of households and businesses and thus have implications for economic activity, employment, and inflation. The Federal Reserve steers the federal funds rate into its target range primarily by changing the interest rate paid on reserve balances and the interest rate of its overnight reverse repurchase facility.
- The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sets a target range for the federal funds rate. The FOMC has eight regularly scheduled meetings each year and announces its policy decisions at 2 p.m. Eastern Time on the second day of each meeting. The FOMC is made up of members of the Board of Governors, who are based in Washington, D.C., and Federal Reserve Bank presidents from around the country.

### Summary
The Federal Reserve's monetary policy aims to achieve maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. Following the October 2025 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the Fed decreased interest rates by 25 basis points (bps), adjusting the upper bound of the target federal funds range. This decision reflects the Fed's ongoing review of its monetary policy strategy and tools, which is part of its commitment to adapt to changing economic conditions. For more details on the FOMC's decisions and upcoming meetings, you can visit the [Federal Reserve's monetary policy page](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy.htm).
