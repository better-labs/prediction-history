# Will Zohran Mamdani win the 2025 NYC mayoral election?

## **AI Prediction Delta: 2.25%**

## AI Prediction Overview

- **Market Prediction:** 87.25%
- **AI Prediction:** 85%
- **Confidence:** 85%

### Key Factors
- Decisive Democratic primary victory with 7-point margin over Cuomo
- Historical pattern: Democrats have won every NYC mayoral election since 2009 with 67-73% margins
- Current polling shows 50% support with 28-point lead over nearest competitor
- Broad coalition extending beyond progressive base to include diverse ethnic and economic groups
- Weak and divided opposition with multiple scandal-plagued candidates
- Strong endorsement from Democratic establishment including Governor Hochul
- High unfavorability ratings for main opponents (60% for Cuomo, 68% for Adams)
- Momentum and media narrative describing victory as 'inevitable'
- Even in head-to-head scenarios, Mamdani leads all opponents by double digits
- Multi-candidate field prevents opposition consolidation

### Outcome Reasoning
(1) PRIMARY VICTORY ESTABLISHES STRONG FOUNDATION

Mamdani won the Democratic primary on June 24, 2025, with a decisive 7-point lead over former Governor Andrew Cuomo (43.5% to 36.4% in first-choice votes according to Source 5). This victory is particularly significant given that Democratic candidates have won every NYC mayoral election since 2009, with margins of 67-73% (Source 1). The Democratic nomination in New York City has historically been tantamount to winning the general election.

(2) COMMANDING POLLING LEAD IN GENERAL ELECTION

Multiple sources confirm Mamdani's dominant position heading into the November general election:
• A Zenith Research/Public Progress Solutions poll shows Mamdani at 50% support among likely voters (Source 7)
• His nearest competitor, Andrew Cuomo running as an independent, polls at only 22%
• GOP nominee Curtis Sliwa at 13% and Mayor Eric Adams at 7%
• Even in hypothetical head-to-head scenarios, Mamdani leads Cuomo 55%-40% and Adams 59%-32%

These margins suggest a nearly insurmountable lead with the election approaching.

(3) BROAD COALITION BUILDING BEYOND PROGRESSIVE BASE

While initially seen as a progressive/DSA candidate, Mamdani has built an "unprecedented coalition" (Source 5) that extends beyond traditional leftist strongholds:
• Strong support in eastern Queens, central and southern Brooklyn, and northern Manhattan
• Backing from Muslims, South Asians, and rent-stabilized tenants (Source 4)
• Endorsements from the Democratic establishment, including Governor Kathy Hochul and Speaker Carl Heastie (Source 4)
• A reported phone call with Barack Obama (Source 4)

This broad coalition mirrors the successful formula of candidates who transcend their base to achieve citywide victory.

(4) WEAK AND DIVIDED OPPOSITION

The opposition faces severe structural disadvantages:
• 60% of voters say they would never consider Cuomo, while 68% reject Adams (Source 7)
• The field remains split among multiple candidates (Cuomo, Adams, Sliwa, Jim Walden), preventing consolidation against Mamdani
• Adams' corruption indictment history and Cuomo's scandals create significant baggage
• Bloomberg (Source 6) notes Adams faced "record low" approval ratings before the race

(5) MOMENTUM AND INEVITABILITY NARRATIVE

Source 4 is titled "Zohran is Inevitable," reflecting the growing consensus that Mamdani's victory is all but certain. Time Magazine (Source 3) describes his transformation "from local long shot to likely mayor of America's biggest city" over eight months. This momentum creates a self-reinforcing cycle of support, endorsements, and media coverage.

### Confidence Reasoning
(1) HIGH-QUALITY POLLING DATA WITH CONSISTENT RESULTS

The confidence level is anchored by robust polling showing Mamdani at 50% support (Source 7), which represents an absolute majority in a multi-candidate race. This is particularly significant because:
• The poll was conducted by Zenith Research/Public Progress Solutions with 1,000 likely voters
• Multiple sources corroborate his strong position without contradictory data
• The margin over competitors (28 points over Cuomo) provides substantial buffer against typical polling error

(2) HISTORICAL PRECEDENT STRONGLY FAVORS DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE

Source 1 provides critical historical context: Democratic candidates have won every NYC mayoral election since 2009 with 67-73% of the vote. This establishes a strong baseline probability for any Democratic nominee, and Mamdani's current 50% polling suggests he's on track to meet or exceed this historical pattern.

(3) MULTIPLE INDEPENDENT SOURCES CONFIRM TRAJECTORY

The research includes diverse, credible sources:
• Major news outlets: New York Times, Bloomberg, Vanity Fair
• Political analysis sites: Politico, Political Wire, Semafor
• Local NYC publications: City & State NY
• Personal analysis blogs that provide ground-level perspective

All sources consistently describe Mamdani as the frontrunner with strong momentum, with no contradictory evidence suggesting a competitive race.

(4) LIMITATIONS PREVENTING HIGHER CONFIDENCE

Several factors prevent confidence from reaching 90%+:
• The election is still several weeks away (November 4, 2025), allowing time for unforeseen developments
• Source 1 mentions a 30-40% chance of alternative scenarios, though these require multiple unlikely events
• Some research appears dated (Source 2 published September 30, Source 3 published August 14), though more recent sources confirm continued strength
• The unusual multi-candidate general election field creates some unpredictability compared to typical two-candidate races

(5) DATA RECENCY AND COMPREHENSIVENESS

Most sources are from summer 2025 (June-September), providing recent snapshots of the race. However, the most recent polling data (Source 7, July 29) is now approximately 2-3 months old relative to the November election date. Despite this gap, the consistency across all timeframes and sources supports maintained confidence in the prediction.

Current predictions suggest he has a 72% chance of winning, compared to Eric Adams' 21%. While Mamdani's support primarily comes from younger voters and progressive groups, the election outcome will depend on how the broader electorate perceives him compared to other candidates. \n\nAdams, who chose not to participate in the Democratic primary, may face Mamdani as an independent candidate in the general election. Although Mamdani's victory seems likely, it is not guaranteed, with a 30-40% chance of an alternative scenario where Adams could win if certain conditions align. Overall, while Mamdani's prospects look favorable, the election remains competitive.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- What are the chances that Zohran Mamdani will win the 2025 New York City mayoral race? It’s as close to certain as you can get that Zohran Mamdani will received incomparably more votes than Eric Adams in the New York City mayoral election in November. Adams chose not to participate in yesterday’s Democratic primary. It was a wise choice since, had he run, Adams likely would have finished in 7th place in the voting.\n- Of course, it’s far too early to have polling data for the general election in November. However, the Democratic candidate has won every NYC mayoral election since 2009 (Adams won 67% in 2021, De Blasio won 67% in 2017 and 73% in 2013). Even if Cuomo does run as an independent in November, his relatively poor showing in the Democratic primary, along with the many skeletons in his closet, should preclude him from a strong showing or as a Mamdani spoiler.\n- Adams will face Mamdani in the general election running as an independent. Other candidates include perennial GOP nominee Curtis Sliwa (who lost to Adams in 2021 after receiving only 28% of the vote). Andrew Cuomo, after losing the Democratic primary to Mamdani yesterday, has asserted that he might against Mamdani as an independent, and Jim Walden, who served as the Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York from 1993 to 2002.\n\n### Content\nWhat are the chances that Zohran Mamdani will win the 2025 New York City mayoral race?

A good chance, but not a slam dunk. Mamdanis’s primary upset over Cuomo has thrown the race into a tizzy. Since his support is primarily from younger voters and the Progressive left, combined with the Asian and Muslim communities, everyone else is currently assessing the situation. The outcome will ultimately hinge on how terrified the rest of the city is about having Mamdani in office compared to literally anyone else. Here is the most likely alternative scenario to a Mamdani win: Cuomo does not run as an independent Trump appoints Sliwa to some federal position (ambassador, homeland security, etc.) Sliwa moves out of state, thus dropping from the ballot The Republ\n\n---\n\n## Source 2: Zohran Mamdani and the Future of American Politics\nURL: https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/zohran-mamdani-and-the-future-of-american-politics\nPublished: 2025-09-30T10:00:00.000Z\nAuthor: James Pogue\n\n### Summary\nThe article discusses Zohran Mamdani's potential impact on American politics, particularly in the context of his candidacy for the 2025 NYC mayoral election. It highlights his unique approach, contrasting him with traditional Democratic candidates. Mamdani, who has garnered support from a diverse coalition, including poor immigrants, aims to inspire a new vision for the Democratic Party, reminiscent of the liberalism of the 1960s. His ability to connect with voters and his desire to stand out in a party often dominated by older figures may position him favorably in the upcoming election. However, the article also notes the historical distrust between certain communities and candidates like Mamdani, which could influence his chances. Overall, while Mamdani shows promise, the outcome of the election will depend on various factors, including voter sentiment and campaign dynamics.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- And in all this time there has only been a handful, if that, of politicians who have inspired as much hope for a new Democratic vision as Zohran Mamdani. Mamdani pronounces his first name with a slightly aspirated _h_ and emphasis on the second syllable. It’s a pronunciation he came to favor over the more casual “ _Zoh_-ran” amid a long process of becoming “confident in who I am and where I come from,” as he would put it, which shapes much of his story.\n- He also had a fervent base of support from a bloc of poor immigrants whose values and religion had long been seen as dangerous, alien, and simply un-American. Then he transcended that base. By the time the general election came around, it was hard to imagine that anyone else could have been the nominee. It was 1960, the year Lyndon Baines Johnson lost the Democratic presidential primary to [John Fitzgerald Kennedy](https://www.vanityfair.com/topic/john-f-kennedy?srsltid=AfmBOoq8CYnAJjBRavqmQ_5Ph2O-yLxjtDQuqBBHG7k-ZBYsH4GhaExr).\n- Late this past August, [Zohran Mamdani](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/john-catsimatidis-on-zohran-mamdani?srsltid=AfmBOopNAXyAINHQvyMFw4mRyjZuphzjAB9uXaJ3YO7SfJ8RxVql31ti) took in a service at the First Baptist Church of Crown Heights, a Black church on Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn. The congregation moved into its current location not long after Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, a year that looks in retrospect like the high-water mark of American liberalism, before the riots of ’68, the spiraling of the New Left into radical terrorism, Reagan and the shattering of the Democratic coalition, Trump and a new turn among conservatives against the philosophy of liberalism itself.\n\n### Content\n[Skip to main content](https://www.vanityfair.com/www.vanityfair.com#main-content)\n\nSave this story\n\nSave this story\n\nIt was the primary fight that changed the course of the [Democratic Party](https://www.vanityfair.com/topic/democratic-party?srsltid=AfmBOoo894UdoP4jL9XWxfj1xOj-7gsOZIRMZ7cVQUaOSV7G_9wRooaC). A craggy-faced master of insider politics squared off against a suave and handsome upstart, whose youth and relative inexperience masked the fact that he had a very hard-nosed understanding of machine politics. The older man was confident. He sat back and quietly logged support from party dons, donors, insiders. He would step in when the moment was right.\n\nThe younger man campaigned at a pace that seemed to test his physical limits. He and his network of supporters badgered every ward heeler and union boss who would listen, often with a simple request that they agree to meet the candidate. Because if you met the candidate, you would be charmed, sure, but you would also learn that he was very serious about this thing, that he intended to win, and that he had plans for what he’d do when he did. He also had a fervent base of support from a bloc of poor immigrants whose values and religion had long been seen as dangerous, alien, and simply un-American. Then he transcended that base. By the time the general election came around, it was hard to imagine that anyone else could have been the nominee.

His political style resonates with many progressives, focusing on principled, pocketbook issues and leveraging online platforms to connect with voters. While he is seen as a fresh voice with innovative ideas, his lack of experience compared to predecessors raises questions about his ability to govern effectively. The outcome of his candidacy will be pivotal for the Democratic Party's future, as it could either restore faith in government or reinforce skepticism among voters nationwide. Whether he will win the election remains uncertain, but his rise has certainly made him a significant contender.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- [Become a member to get many great benefits](https://members.politicalwire.com/join) \\-\\- exclusive analysis, trending news, a private podcast, no ads and more![Time](https://time.com/7308924/zohran-mamdani-interview-time/): “Before 2025, basically no one knew who Mamdani was.

His popularity has surged, attracting endorsements from key political figures and a growing base of support. Despite potential challenges from opponents like Andrew Cuomo and Eric Adams, Mamdani's campaign momentum appears strong, with polling indicating he may exceed fifty percent of the vote. The article discusses the evolution of his campaign and the political dynamics at play, suggesting that Mamdani's victory is increasingly likely as the election date approaches.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Since the night of June 24th, Mamdani has become one of the most acclaimed — and polarizing — politicians in the nation. A brief sojourn to Uganda to celebrate his nuptials did not interrupt the hype. Much of the Democratic establishment, quietly impressed throughout the Primary, has flocked to Mamdani.

Mamdani began his campaign, in the days after Trump’s victory, talking to voters on Fordham Road in the Bronx and Hillside Avenue in Queens; local working-class constituencies the Democratic Party had forgotten. His victory was not solely a triumph of _The Commie Corridor_, but under-represented and oft-overlooked New Yorkers: [Muslims](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/25/nyregion/nyc-voters-muslim-zohran-mamdani.html), [South Asians](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/25/nyregion/mamdani-south-asian-voters.html), rent-stabilized tenants.\n- Now, Zohran Mamdani has more endorsements than the rest of the field _combined_— several times over. And, while his opponents poll numbers have flatlined, Mamdani’s have steadily risen, on pace to exceed fifty-percent. Inevitably, the day-to-day contours of Mamdani’s campaign, when compared to the Democratic Primary, is different. His team, once a scrappy cadre of underdogs, has grown to more than two dozen.\n\n### Content\n# [The Narrative Wars](https://www.michaellange.nyc/)\n\nSubscribeSign in\n\n# Zohran is Inevitable\n\n### But can Mamdani keep the Magic?\n\n[Michael Lange](https://substack.com/@michaellangenyc)\n\nSep 25, 2025\n\n61\n\n[19](https://www.michaellange.nyc/p/zohran-is-inevitable/comments)\n9\n\n[Share](javascript:void(0))\n\nOn November 4th, Zohran Mamdani will be elected the next Mayor of New York City.\n\nSince the night of June 24th, Mamdani has become one of the most acclaimed — and polarizing — politicians in the nation. A brief sojourn to Uganda to celebrate his nuptials did not interrupt the hype. Much of the Democratic establishment, quietly impressed throughout the Primary, has flocked to Mamdani.

A phone call with Barack Obama was reported by _[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/13/opinion/mamdani-obama-democrats.html)_.

He is not only the talk of this town of almost nine million, but the United States of America.\n\nDespite Mamdani’s twelve point victory in the Democratic Primary, none of this was guaranteed. In the weeks thereafter, the billionaire class, caught flat footed in June, foreshadowed a tidal wave of outside spending come November, while scheming to narrow the field down to two.

As of election night, Mamdani held a 7-point lead in first-choice votes, securing 43.5% compared to Cuomo's 36.4%. His victory marks a historic upset, as he transformed from an unknown candidate to a formidable contender backed by a grassroots movement and the Democratic Socialists of America. While the final results will depend on ranked-choice voting, political analysts suggest that Mamdani's lead makes it unlikely for Cuomo to catch up. Mamdani's progressive platform and ability to engage younger voters have been pivotal to his success.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- In an election night showing more decisive than even his most optimistic supporters dared to dream of, Zohran Mamdani toppled a political Goliath Tuesday. As of 10 p.m., the 33-year-old insurgent candidate held a strong 7-point lead in first-choice voters over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary for mayor. “My friends, we have done it,” Mamdani said just a little after midnight, addressing supporters at a packed campaign party in Long Island City, Queens.\n- Leading up to election day, there was a groundswell of support in his favor, drawn to his economic populist message, charisma, positivity and creative social media strategy. And his support was ultimately not limited to young gentrifier types in brownstone Brooklyn and lower Manhattan. On election night, he appeared to have a lead in areas of eastern Queens and central and southern Brooklyn as well as northern Manhattan – all regions previously unwelcoming to leftist candidates.It was this \"unprecedented coalition” Mamdani spoke of Tuesday night.\n- Much still looms. The primary election is not necessarily the end of the mayoral race this year. In many ways, it’s a preview for the November general election, which could have five major candidates on the ballot. Adams, buoyed by the dismissal of his federal charges and hellbent on redemption, will be on the ballot as an independent as will the well-funded lawyer Jim Walden.\n\n### Content\n[Skip to Content](https://www.cityandstateny.com/www.cityandstateny.com#main)\n\nBy [Annie McDonough](https://www.cityandstateny.com/voices/annie-mcdonough/17228/?oref=csny-post-author?oref=rf-post-author) and [Sahalie Donaldson](https://www.cityandstateny.com/voices/sahalie-donaldson/17565/?oref=csny-post-author?oref=rf-post-author)\n\n\\| June 24, 2025\n\nBy [Annie McDonough](https://www.cityandstateny.com/voices/annie-mcdonough/17228/?oref=csny-post-author?oref=rf-post-author) and [Sahalie Donaldson](https://www.cityandstateny.com/voices/sahalie-donaldson/17565/?oref=csny-post-author?oref=rf-post-author)\n\nJune 24, 2025\n\n- [2025 New York City Mayoral Election](https://www.cityandstateny.com/topic/2025-New-York-City-Mayoral-Election/?oref=csny-article-topics)\n- [Campaigns & Elections](https://www.cityandstateny.com/topic/campaigns-elections/?oref=csny-article-topics)\n- [News & Politics](https://www.cityandstateny.com/topic/news-politics/?oref=csny-article-topics)\n- [New York City](https://www.cityandstateny.com/topic/new-york-city/?oref=csny-article-topics)\n\nIn an election night showing more decisive than even his most optimistic supporters dared to dream of, Zohran Mamdani toppled a political Goliath Tuesday.

Adams, who faced significant challenges due to low approval ratings and a federal corruption indictment, may benefit from the changing political landscape. While the article does not provide a definitive answer regarding Mamdani's chances of winning, it highlights the competitive nature of the race and the potential for Adams to regain support amidst Mamdani's rise.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Just days ago, the New York City mayor faced steep reelection odds. His job-approval ratings had plunged to record lows after a federal corruption indictment.

His main rivals, former Governor Andrew Cuomo and GOP nominee Curtis Sliwa, trail significantly, with Cuomo at 22% and Sliwa at 13%. The poll indicates that even if Cuomo or Mayor Eric Adams were to drop out and endorse each other, they would still not come close to Mamdani's support. Notably, about 60% of voters would never consider Cuomo, and 68% feel the same about Adams, highlighting the challenges they face. Overall, the data strongly suggests that Mamdani is well-positioned to win the election.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- The scandal-scarred independents running for New York City mayor stand little chance against [front-runner Zohran Mamdani](https://www.aol.com/news/mamdani-nyc-mayoral-front-runner-230931548.html)— even if the rivals team up against the socialist candidate, a shocking new poll found. Mamdani, a Queens assemblyman and the Democratic nominee, is projected to handily win the November general election with 50% of likely voters in the latest survey, released Tuesday by Zenith Research/Public Progress Solutions.\n- Ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has [decided to continue his comeback tour](https://www.aol.com/news/andrew-cuomo-confirms-independent-run-192842321.html) after his embarrassing June primary loss to 33-year-old Mamdani, came in a distant second at 22%, while GOP nominee Curtis Sliwa pulled 13%. Mayor Eric Adams, who bailed on the Democratic Party line after his historic corruption case took months for the Trump administration to kill, failed to muster more than 7% support.\n- About 60% of likely voters said they would never consider voting for Cuomo, while 68% of those polled said Adams will never be their choice come November. And Mamdani would win with 51% if Adams drops from the race, with Cuomo only netting 25% in the scenario and Sliwa receiving 15%, according to the poll.\n\n### Content\nCraig McCarthy\n\nJuly 29, 2025 at 4:29 PM\n\n0\n\n- Copied\n\nThe scandal-scarred independents running for New York City mayor stand little chance against [front-runner Zohran Mamdani](https://www.aol.com/news/mamdani-nyc-mayoral-front-runner-230931548.html)— even if the rivals team up against the socialist candidate, a shocking new poll found.\n\nMamdani, a Queens assemblyman and the Democratic nominee, is projected to handily win the November general election with 50% of likely voters in the latest survey, released Tuesday by Zenith Research/Public Progress Solutions.\n\nEx-Gov.

His campaign focused on affordability and resonated particularly with younger voters, despite facing accusations of anti-Semitism from his opponent, Andrew Cuomo. The primary results indicate a shift among Democrats towards new leadership, suggesting Mamdani could potentially win the mayoral election in 2025. His victory is seen as a significant moment for the Democratic party and may present challenges for Republican candidates.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- A young, formerly unknown democratic socialist won the Democratic primary for mayor of New York City, making him the frontrunner to be its next leader. Zohran Mamdani focused relentlessly on affordability while young voters rallied around his cheerful vibe and pro-Palestinian politics. His veteran opponent Andrew Cuomo accused him of anti-Semitism — the city has more Jews than anywhere outside Israel — but conceded after what The New York Times called a “ [joyless](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/25/nyregion/mamdani-speech-watch-party.html)” campaign.\n- The result showed that Democrats appeared ready “ [to throw off old leaders,](https://www.semafor.com/article/06/23/2025/new-york-city-democrats-mamdani-socialist-cuomo)” as Semafor’s David Weigel put it.

This establishes a strong baseline probability for any Democratic nominee, and Mamdani's current 50% polling suggests he's on track to meet or exceed this historical pattern.\n\n(3) MULTIPLE INDEPENDENT SOURCES CONFIRM TRAJECTORY\n\nThe research includes diverse, credible sources:\n• Major news outlets: New York Times, Bloomberg, Vanity Fair\n• Political analysis sites: Politico, Political Wire, Semafor\n• Local NYC publications: City & State NY\n• Personal analysis blogs that provide ground-level perspective\n\nAll sources consistently describe Mamdani as the frontrunner with strong momentum, with no contradictory evidence suggesting a competitive race.\n\n(4) LIMITATIONS PREVENTING HIGHER CONFIDENCE\n\nSeveral factors prevent confidence from reaching 90%+:\n• The election is still several weeks away (November 4, 2025), allowing time for unforeseen developments\n• Source 1 mentions a 30-40% chance of alternative scenarios, though these require multiple unlikely events\n• Some research appears dated (Source 2 published September 30, Source 3 published August 14), though more recent sources confirm continued strength\n• The unusual multi-candidate general election field creates some unpredictability compared to typical two-candidate races\n\n(5) DATA RECENCY AND COMPREHENSIVENESS\n\nMost sources are from summer 2025 (June-September), providing recent snapshots of the race. However, the most recent polling data (Source 7, July 29) is now approximately 2-3 months old relative to the November election date. Despite this gap, the consistency across all timeframes and sources supports maintained confidence in the prediction.",

Current predictions suggest he has a 72% chance of winning, compared to Eric Adams' 21%. While Mamdani's support primarily comes from younger voters and progressive groups, the election outcome will depend on how the broader electorate perceives him compared to other candidates. \n\nAdams, who chose not to participate in the Democratic primary, may face Mamdani as an independent candidate in the general election. Although Mamdani's victory seems likely, it is not guaranteed, with a 30-40% chance of an alternative scenario where Adams could win if certain conditions align. Overall, while Mamdani's prospects look favorable, the election remains competitive.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- What are the chances that Zohran Mamdani will win the 2025 New York City mayoral race? It’s as close to certain as you can get that Zohran Mamdani will received incomparably more votes than Eric Adams in the New York City mayoral election in November. Adams chose not to participate in yesterday’s Democratic primary. It was a wise choice since, had he run, Adams likely would have finished in 7th place in the voting.\n- Of course, it’s far too early to have polling data for the general election in November. However, the Democratic candidate has won every NYC mayoral election since 2009 (Adams won 67% in 2021, De Blasio won 67% in 2017 and 73% in 2013). Even if Cuomo does run as an independent in November, his relatively poor showing in the Democratic primary, along with the many skeletons in his closet, should preclude him from a strong showing or as a Mamdani spoiler.\n- Adams will face Mamdani in the general election running as an independent. Other candidates include perennial GOP nominee Curtis Sliwa (who lost to Adams in 2021 after receiving only 28% of the vote). Andrew Cuomo, after losing the Democratic primary to Mamdani yesterday, has asserted that he might against Mamdani as an independent, and Jim Walden, who served as the Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York from 1993 to 2002.\n\n### Content\nWhat are the chances that Zohran Mamdani will win the 2025 New York City mayoral race?

A good chance, but not a slam dunk. Mamdanis’s primary upset over Cuomo has thrown the race into a tizzy. Since his support is primarily from younger voters and the Progressive left, combined with the Asian and Muslim communities, everyone else is currently assessing the situation. The outcome will ultimately hinge on how terrified the rest of the city is about having Mamdani in office compared to literally anyone else. Here is the most likely alternative scenario to a Mamdani win: Cuomo does not run as an independent Trump appoints Sliwa to some federal position (ambassador, homeland security, etc.) Sliwa moves out of state, thus dropping from the ballot The Republ\n\n---\n\n## Source 2: Zohran Mamdani and the Future of American Politics\nURL: https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/zohran-mamdani-and-the-future-of-american-politics\nPublished: 2025-09-30T10:00:00.000Z\nAuthor: James Pogue\n\n### Summary\nThe article discusses Zohran Mamdani's potential impact on American politics, particularly in the context of his candidacy for the 2025 NYC mayoral election. It highlights his unique approach, contrasting him with traditional Democratic candidates. Mamdani, who has garnered support from a diverse coalition, including poor immigrants, aims to inspire a new vision for the Democratic Party, reminiscent of the liberalism of the 1960s. His ability to connect with voters and his desire to stand out in a party often dominated by older figures may position him favorably in the upcoming election. However, the article also notes the historical distrust between certain communities and candidates like Mamdani, which could influence his chances. Overall, while Mamdani shows promise, the outcome of the election will depend on various factors, including voter sentiment and campaign dynamics.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- And in all this time there has only been a handful, if that, of politicians who have inspired as much hope for a new Democratic vision as Zohran Mamdani. Mamdani pronounces his first name with a slightly aspirated _h_ and emphasis on the second syllable. It’s a pronunciation he came to favor over the more casual “ _Zoh_-ran” amid a long process of becoming “confident in who I am and where I come from,” as he would put it, which shapes much of his story.\n- He also had a fervent base of support from a bloc of poor immigrants whose values and religion had long been seen as dangerous, alien, and simply un-American. Then he transcended that base. By the time the general election came around, it was hard to imagine that anyone else could have been the nominee. It was 1960, the year Lyndon Baines Johnson lost the Democratic presidential primary to [John Fitzgerald Kennedy](https://www.vanityfair.com/topic/john-f-kennedy?srsltid=AfmBOoq8CYnAJjBRavqmQ_5Ph2O-yLxjtDQuqBBHG7k-ZBYsH4GhaExr).\n- Late this past August, [Zohran Mamdani](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/john-catsimatidis-on-zohran-mamdani?srsltid=AfmBOopNAXyAINHQvyMFw4mRyjZuphzjAB9uXaJ3YO7SfJ8RxVql31ti) took in a service at the First Baptist Church of Crown Heights, a Black church on Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn. The congregation moved into its current location not long after Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, a year that looks in retrospect like the high-water mark of American liberalism, before the riots of ’68, the spiraling of the New Left into radical terrorism, Reagan and the shattering of the Democratic coalition, Trump and a new turn among conservatives against the philosophy of liberalism itself.\n\n### Content\n[Skip to main content](https://www.vanityfair.com/www.vanityfair.com#main-content)\n\nSave this story\n\nSave this story\n\nIt was the primary fight that changed the course of the [Democratic Party](https://www.vanityfair.com/topic/democratic-party?srsltid=AfmBOoo894UdoP4jL9XWxfj1xOj-7gsOZIRMZ7cVQUaOSV7G_9wRooaC). A craggy-faced master of insider politics squared off against a suave and handsome upstart, whose youth and relative inexperience masked the fact that he had a very hard-nosed understanding of machine politics. The older man was confident. He sat back and quietly logged support from party dons, donors, insiders. He would step in when the moment was right.\n\nThe younger man campaigned at a pace that seemed to test his physical limits. He and his network of supporters badgered every ward heeler and union boss who would listen, often with a simple request that they agree to meet the candidate. Because if you met the candidate, you would be charmed, sure, but you would also learn that he was very serious about this thing, that he intended to win, and that he had plans for what he’d do when he did. He also had a fervent base of support from a bloc of poor immigrants whose values and religion had long been seen as dangerous, alien, and simply un-American. Then he transcended that base.

His political style resonates with many progressives, focusing on principled, pocketbook issues and leveraging online platforms to connect with voters. While he is seen as a fresh voice with innovative ideas, his lack of experience compared to predecessors raises questions about his ability to govern effectively. The outcome of his candidacy will be pivotal for the Democratic Party's future, as it could either restore faith in government or reinforce skepticism among voters nationwide. Whether he will win the election remains uncertain, but his rise has certainly made him a significant contender.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- [Become a member to get many great benefits](https://members.politicalwire.com/join) \\-\\- exclusive analysis, trending news, a private podcast, no ads and more![Time](https://time.com/7308924/zohran-mamdani-interview-time/): “Before 2025, basically no one knew who Mamdani was.

His popularity has surged, attracting endorsements from key political figures and a growing base of support. Despite potential challenges from opponents like Andrew Cuomo and Eric Adams, Mamdani's campaign momentum appears strong, with polling indicating he may exceed fifty percent of the vote. The article discusses the evolution of his campaign and the political dynamics at play, suggesting that Mamdani's victory is increasingly likely as the election date approaches.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Since the night of June 24th, Mamdani has become one of the most acclaimed — and polarizing — politicians in the nation. A brief sojourn to Uganda to celebrate his nuptials did not interrupt the hype. Much of the Democratic establishment, quietly impressed throughout the Primary, has flocked to Mamdani.

Mamdani began his campaign, in the days after Trump’s victory, talking to voters on Fordham Road in the Bronx and Hillside Avenue in Queens; local working-class constituencies the Democratic Party had forgotten. His victory was not solely a triumph of _The Commie Corridor_, but under-represented and oft-overlooked New Yorkers: [Muslims](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/25/nyregion/nyc-voters-muslim-zohran-mamdani.html), [South Asians](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/25/nyregion/mamdani-south-asian-voters.html), rent-stabilized tenants.\n- Now, Zohran Mamdani has more endorsements than the rest of the field _combined_— several times over. And, while his opponents poll numbers have flatlined, Mamdani’s have steadily risen, on pace to exceed fifty-percent. Inevitably, the day-to-day contours of Mamdani’s campaign, when compared to the Democratic Primary, is different. His team, once a scrappy cadre of underdogs, has grown to more than two dozen.\n\n### Content\n# [The Narrative Wars](https://www.michaellange.nyc/)\n\nSubscribeSign in\n\n# Zohran is Inevitable\n\n### But can Mamdani keep the Magic?\n\n[Michael Lange](https://substack.com/@michaellangenyc)\n\nSep 25, 2025\n\n61\n\n[19](https://www.michaellange.nyc/p/zohran-is-inevitable/comments)\n9\n\n[Share](javascript:void(0))\n\nOn November 4th, Zohran Mamdani will be elected the next Mayor of New York City.\n\nSince the night of June 24th, Mamdani has become one of the most acclaimed — and polarizing — politicians in the nation. A brief sojourn to Uganda to celebrate his nuptials did not interrupt the hype. Much of the Democratic establishment, quietly impressed throughout the Primary, has flocked to Mamdani.

A phone call with Barack Obama was reported by _[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/13/opinion/mamdani-obama-democrats.html)_. All sectors of the political press — local, national, international — clamor for Mamdani-mentum.

He is not only the talk of this town of almost nine million, but the United States of America.\n\nDespite Mamdani’s twelve point victory in the Democratic Primary, none of this was guaranteed. In the weeks thereafter, the billionaire class, caught flat footed in June, foreshadowed a tidal wave of outside spending come November, while scheming to narrow the field down to two.

As of election night, Mamdani held a 7-point lead in first-choice votes, securing 43.5% compared to Cuomo's 36.4%. His victory marks a historic upset, as he transformed from an unknown candidate to a formidable contender backed by a grassroots movement and the Democratic Socialists of America. While the final results will depend on ranked-choice voting, political analysts suggest that Mamdani's lead makes it unlikely for Cuomo to catch up. Mamdani's progressive platform and ability to engage younger voters have been pivotal to his success.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- In an election night showing more decisive than even his most optimistic supporters dared to dream of, Zohran Mamdani toppled a political Goliath Tuesday. As of 10 p.m., the 33-year-old insurgent candidate held a strong 7-point lead in first-choice voters over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary for mayor. “My friends, we have done it,” Mamdani said just a little after midnight, addressing supporters at a packed campaign party in Long Island City, Queens.\n- Leading up to election day, there was a groundswell of support in his favor, drawn to his economic populist message, charisma, positivity and creative social media strategy. And his support was ultimately not limited to young gentrifier types in brownstone Brooklyn and lower Manhattan. On election night, he appeared to have a lead in areas of eastern Queens and central and southern Brooklyn as well as northern Manhattan – all regions previously unwelcoming to leftist candidates.It was this \"unprecedented coalition” Mamdani spoke of Tuesday night.\n- Much still looms. The primary election is not necessarily the end of the mayoral race this year. In many ways, it’s a preview for the November general election, which could have five major candidates on the ballot. Adams, buoyed by the dismissal of his federal charges and hellbent on redemption, will be on the ballot as an independent as will the well-funded lawyer Jim Walden.\n\n### Content\n[Skip to Content](https://www.cityandstateny.com/www.cityandstateny.com#main)\n\nBy [Annie McDonough](https://www.cityandstateny.com/voices/annie-mcdonough/17228/?oref=csny-post-author?oref=rf-post-author) and [Sahalie Donaldson](https://www.cityandstateny.com/voices/sahalie-donaldson/17565/?oref=csny-post-author?oref=rf-post-author)\n\n\\| June 24, 2025\n\nBy [Annie McDonough](https://www.cityandstateny.com/voices/annie-mcdonough/17228/?oref=csny-post-author?oref=rf-post-author) and [Sahalie Donaldson](https://www.cityandstateny.com/voices/sahalie-donaldson/17565/?oref=csny-post-author?oref=rf-post-author)\n\nJune 24, 2025\n\n- [2025 New York City Mayoral Election](https://www.cityandstateny.com/topic/2025-New-York-City-Mayoral-Election/?oref=csny-article-topics)\n- [Campaigns & Elections](https://www.cityandstateny.com/topic/campaigns-elections/?oref=csny-article-topics)\n- [News & Politics](https://www.cityandstateny.com/topic/news-politics/?oref=csny-article-topics)\n- [New York City](https://www.cityandstateny.com/topic/new-york-city/?oref=csny-article-topics)\n\nIn an election night showing more decisive than even his most optimistic supporters dared to dream of, Zohran Mamdani toppled a political Goliath Tuesday.

Adams, who faced significant challenges due to low approval ratings and a federal corruption indictment, may benefit from the changing political landscape.

His main rivals, former Governor Andrew Cuomo and GOP nominee Curtis Sliwa, trail significantly, with Cuomo at 22% and Sliwa at 13%. The poll indicates that even if Cuomo or Mayor Eric Adams were to drop out and endorse each other, they would still not come close to Mamdani's support. Notably, about 60% of voters would never consider Cuomo, and 68% feel the same about Adams, highlighting the challenges they face. Overall, the data strongly suggests that Mamdani is well-positioned to win the election.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- The scandal-scarred independents running for New York City mayor stand little chance against [front-runner Zohran Mamdani](https://www.aol.com/news/mamdani-nyc-mayoral-front-runner-230931548.html)— even if the rivals team up against the socialist candidate, a shocking new poll found. Mamdani, a Queens assemblyman and the Democratic nominee, is projected to handily win the November general election with 50% of likely voters in the latest survey, released Tuesday by Zenith Research/Public Progress Solutions.\n- Ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has [decided to continue his comeback tour](https://www.aol.com/news/andrew-cuomo-confirms-independent-run-192842321.html) after his embarrassing June primary loss to 33-year-old Mamdani, came in a distant second at 22%, while GOP nominee Curtis Sliwa pulled 13%. Mayor Eric Adams, who bailed on the Democratic Party line after his historic corruption case took months for the Trump administration to kill, failed to muster more than 7% support.\n- About 60% of likely voters said they would never consider voting for Cuomo, while 68% of those polled said Adams will never be their choice come November. And Mamdani would win with 51% if Adams drops from the race, with Cuomo only netting 25% in the scenario and Sliwa receiving 15%, according to the poll.\n\n### Content\nCraig McCarthy\n\nJuly 29, 2025 at 4:29 PM\n\n0\n\n- Copied\n\nThe scandal-scarred independents running for New York City mayor stand little chance against [front-runner Zohran Mamdani](https://www.aol.com/news/mamdani-nyc-mayoral-front-runner-230931548.html)— even if the rivals team up against the socialist candidate, a shocking new poll found.\n\nMamdani, a Queens assemblyman and the Democratic nominee, is projected to handily win the November general election with 50% of likely voters in the latest survey, released Tuesday by Zenith Research/Public Progress Solutions.\n\nEx-Gov.

His campaign focused on affordability and resonated particularly with younger voters, despite facing accusations of anti-Semitism from his opponent, Andrew Cuomo. The primary results indicate a shift among Democrats towards new leadership, suggesting Mamdani could potentially win the mayoral election in 2025. His victory is seen as a significant moment for the Democratic party and may present challenges for Republican candidates.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- A young, formerly unknown democratic socialist won the Democratic primary for mayor of New York City, making him the frontrunner to be its next leader. Zohran Mamdani focused relentlessly on affordability while young voters rallied around his cheerful vibe and pro-Palestinian politics.

This victory is particularly significant given that Democratic candidates have won every NYC mayoral election since 2009, with margins of 67-73% (Source 1). The Democratic nomination in New York City has historically been tantamount to winning the general election.\\n\\n(2) COMMANDING POLLING LEAD IN GENERAL ELECTION\\n\\nMultiple sources confirm Mamdani's dominant position heading into the November general election:\\n• A Zenith Research/Public Progress Solutions poll shows Mamdani at 50% support among likely voters (Source 7)\\n• His nearest competitor, Andrew Cuomo running as an independent, polls at only 22%\\n• GOP nominee Curtis Sliwa at 13% and Mayor Eric Adams at 7%\\n• Even in hypothetical head-to-head scenarios, Mamdani leads Cuomo 55%-40% and Adams 59%-32%\\n\\nThese margins suggest a nearly insurmountable lead with the election approaching.\\n\\n(3) BROAD COALITION BUILDING BEYOND PROGRESSIVE BASE\\n\\nWhile initially seen as a progressive/DSA candidate, Mamdani has built an \\\"unprecedented coalition\\\" (Source 5) that extends beyond traditional leftist strongholds:\\n• Strong support in eastern Queens, central and southern Brooklyn, and northern Manhattan\\n• Backing from Muslims, South Asians, and rent-stabilized tenants (Source 4)\\n• Endorsements from the Democratic establishment, including Governor Kathy Hochul and Speaker Carl Heastie (Source 4)\\n• A reported phone call with Barack Obama (Source 4)\\n\\nThis broad coalition mirrors the successful formula of candidates who transcend their base to achieve citywide victory.\\n\\n(4) WEAK AND DIVIDED OPPOSITION\\n\\nThe opposition faces severe structural disadvantages:\\n• 60% of voters say they would never consider Cuomo, while 68% reject Adams (Source 7)\\n• The field remains split among multiple candidates (Cuomo, Adams, Sliwa, Jim Walden), preventing consolidation against Mamdani\\n• Adams' corruption indictment history and Cuomo's scandals create significant baggage\\n• Bloomberg (Source 6) notes Adams faced \\\"record low\\\" approval ratings before the race\\n\\n(5) MOMENTUM AND INEVITABILITY NARRATIVE\\n\\nSource 4 is titled \\\"Zohran is Inevitable,\\\" reflecting the growing consensus that Mamdani's victory is all but certain. Time Magazine (Source 3) describes his transformation \\\"from local long shot to likely mayor of America's biggest city\\\" over eight months.

This is particularly significant because:\\n• The poll was conducted by Zenith Research/Public Progress Solutions with 1,000 likely voters\\n• Multiple sources corroborate his strong position without contradictory data\\n• The margin over competitors (28 points over Cuomo) provides substantial buffer against typical polling error\\n\\n(2) HISTORICAL PRECEDENT STRONGLY FAVORS DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE\\n\\nSource 1 provides critical historical context: Democratic candidates have won every NYC mayoral election since 2009 with 67-73% of the vote. This establishes a strong baseline probability for any Democratic nominee, and Mamdani's current 50% polling suggests he's on track to meet or exceed this historical pattern.\\n\\n(3) MULTIPLE INDEPENDENT SOURCES CONFIRM TRAJECTORY\\n\\nThe research includes diverse, credible sources:\\n• Major news outlets: New York Times, Bloomberg, Vanity Fair\\n• Political analysis sites: Politico, Political Wire, Semafor\\n• Local NYC publications: City & State NY\\n• Personal analysis blogs that provide ground-level perspective\\n\\nAll sources consistently describe Mamdani as the frontrunner with strong momentum, with no contradictory evidence suggesting a competitive race.\\n\\n(4) LIMITATIONS PREVENTING HIGHER CONFIDENCE\\n\\nSeveral factors prevent confidence from reaching 90%+:\\n• The election is still several weeks away (November 4, 2025), allowing time for unforeseen developments\\n• Source 1 mentions a 30-40% chance of alternative scenarios, though these require multiple unlikely events\\n• Some research appears dated (Source 2 published September 30, Source 3 published August 14), though more recent sources confirm continued strength\\n• The unusual multi-candidate general election field creates some unpredictability compared to typical two-candidate races\\n\\n(5) DATA RECENCY AND COMPREHENSIVENESS\\n\\nMost sources are from summer 2025 (June-September), providing recent snapshots of the race. However, the most recent polling data (Source 7, July 29) is now approximately 2-3 months old relative to the November election date.

Current predictions suggest he has a 72% chance of winning, compared to Eric Adams' 21%. While Mamdani's support primarily comes from younger voters and progressive groups, the election outcome will depend on how the broader electorate perceives him compared to other candidates. \n\nAdams, who chose not to participate in the Democratic primary, may face Mamdani as an independent candidate in the general election. Although Mamdani's victory seems likely, it is not guaranteed, with a 30-40% chance of an alternative scenario where Adams could win if certain conditions align. Overall, while Mamdani's prospects look favorable, the election remains competitive.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- What are the chances that Zohran Mamdani will win the 2025 New York City mayoral race? It’s as close to certain as you can get that Zohran Mamdani will received incomparably more votes than Eric Adams in the New York City mayoral election in November. Adams chose not to participate in yesterday’s Democratic primary. It was a wise choice since, had he run, Adams likely would have finished in 7th place in the voting.\n- Of course, it’s far too early to have polling data for the general election in November. However, the Democratic candidate has won every NYC mayoral election since 2009 (Adams won 67% in 2021, De Blasio won 67% in 2017 and 73% in 2013). Even if Cuomo does run as an independent in November, his relatively poor showing in the Democratic primary, along with the many skeletons in his closet, should preclude him from a strong showing or as a Mamdani spoiler.\n- Adams will face Mamdani in the general election running as an independent. Other candidates include perennial GOP nominee Curtis Sliwa (who lost to Adams in 2021 after receiving only 28% of the vote). Andrew Cuomo, after losing the Democratic primary to Mamdani yesterday, has asserted that he might against Mamdani as an independent, and Jim Walden, who served as the Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York from 1993 to 2002.\n\n### Content\nWhat are the chances that Zohran Mamdani will win the 2025 New York City mayoral race?

A good chance, but not a slam dunk. Mamdanis’s primary upset over Cuomo has thrown the race into a tizzy. Since his support is primarily from younger voters and the Progressive left, combined with the Asian and Muslim communities, everyone else is currently assessing the situation. The outcome will ultimately hinge on how terrified the rest of the city is about having Mamdani in office compared to literally anyone else. Here is the most likely alternative scenario to a Mamdani win: Cuomo does not run as an independent Trump appoints Sliwa to some federal position (ambassador, homeland security, etc.) Sliwa moves out of state, thus dropping from the ballot The Republ\n\n---\n\n## Source 2: Zohran Mamdani and the Future of American Politics\nURL: https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/zohran-mamdani-and-the-future-of-american-politics\nPublished: 2025-09-30T10:00:00.000Z\nAuthor: James Pogue\n\n### Summary\nThe article discusses Zohran Mamdani's potential impact on American politics, particularly in the context of his candidacy for the 2025 NYC mayoral election. It highlights his unique approach, contrasting him with traditional Democratic candidates. Mamdani, who has garnered support from a diverse coalition, including poor immigrants, aims to inspire a new vision for the Democratic Party, reminiscent of the liberalism of the 1960s. His ability to connect with voters and his desire to stand out in a party often dominated by older figures may position him favorably in the upcoming election. However, the article also notes the historical distrust between certain communities and candidates like Mamdani, which could influence his chances. Overall, while Mamdani shows promise, the outcome of the election will depend on various factors, including voter sentiment and campaign dynamics.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- And in all this time there has only been a handful, if that, of politicians who have inspired as much hope for a new Democratic vision as Zohran Mamdani. Mamdani pronounces his first name with a slightly aspirated _h_ and emphasis on the second syllable. It’s a pronunciation he came to favor over the more casual “ _Zoh_-ran” amid a long process of becoming “confident in who I am and where I come from,” as he would put it, which shapes much of his story.\n- He also had a fervent base of support from a bloc of poor immigrants whose values and religion had long been seen as dangerous, alien, and simply un-American. Then he transcended that base. By the time the general election came around, it was hard to imagine that anyone else could have been the nominee. It was 1960, the year Lyndon Baines Johnson lost the Democratic presidential primary to [John Fitzgerald Kennedy](https://www.vanityfair.com/topic/john-f-kennedy?srsltid=AfmBOoq8CYnAJjBRavqmQ_5Ph2O-yLxjtDQuqBBHG7k-ZBYsH4GhaExr).\n- Late this past August, [Zohran Mamdani](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/john-catsimatidis-on-zohran-mamdani?srsltid=AfmBOopNAXyAINHQvyMFw4mRyjZuphzjAB9uXaJ3YO7SfJ8RxVql31ti) took in a service at the First Baptist Church of Crown Heights, a Black church on Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn. The congregation moved into its current location not long after Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, a year that looks in retrospect like the high-water mark of American liberalism, before the riots of ’68, the spiraling of the New Left into radical terrorism, Reagan and the shattering of the Democratic coalition, Trump and a new turn among conservatives against the philosophy of liberalism itself.\n\n### Content\n[Skip to main content](https://www.vanityfair.com/www.vanityfair.com#main-content)\n\nSave this story\n\nSave this story\n\nIt was the primary fight that changed the course of the [Democratic Party](https://www.vanityfair.com/topic/democratic-party?srsltid=AfmBOoo894UdoP4jL9XWxfj1xOj-7gsOZIRMZ7cVQUaOSV7G_9wRooaC). A craggy-faced master of insider politics squared off against a suave and handsome upstart, whose youth and relative inexperience masked the fact that he had a very hard-nosed understanding of machine politics. The older man was confident. He sat back and quietly logged support from party dons, donors, insiders. He would step in when the moment was right.\n\nThe younger man campaigned at a pace that seemed to test his physical limits. He and his network of supporters badgered every ward heeler and union boss who would listen, often with a simple request that they agree to meet the candidate. Because if you met the candidate, you would be charmed, sure, but you would also learn that he was very serious about this thing, that he intended to win, and that he had plans for what he’d do when he did. He also had a fervent base of support from a bloc of poor immigrants whose values and religion had long been seen as dangerous, alien, and simply un-American. Then he transcended that base. By the time the general election came around, it was hard to imagine that anyone else could have been the nominee.

His political style resonates with many progressives, focusing on principled, pocketbook issues and leveraging online platforms to connect with voters. While he is seen as a fresh voice with innovative ideas, his lack of experience compared to predecessors raises questions about his ability to govern effectively. The outcome of his candidacy will be pivotal for the Democratic Party's future, as it could either restore faith in government or reinforce skepticism among voters nationwide. Whether he will win the election remains uncertain, but his rise has certainly made him a significant contender.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- [Become a member to get many great benefits](https://members.politicalwire.com/join) \\-\\- exclusive analysis, trending news, a private podcast, no ads and more![Time](https://time.com/7308924/zohran-mamdani-interview-time/): “Before 2025, basically no one knew who Mamdani was.

His popularity has surged, attracting endorsements from key political figures and a growing base of support. Despite potential challenges from opponents like Andrew Cuomo and Eric Adams, Mamdani's campaign momentum appears strong, with polling indicating he may exceed fifty percent of the vote. The article discusses the evolution of his campaign and the political dynamics at play, suggesting that Mamdani's victory is increasingly likely as the election date approaches.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Since the night of June 24th, Mamdani has become one of the most acclaimed — and polarizing — politicians in the nation. A brief sojourn to Uganda to celebrate his nuptials did not interrupt the hype. Much of the Democratic establishment, quietly impressed throughout the Primary, has flocked to Mamdani. Even Governor Kathy Hochul, an Upstate moderate, bent the metaphorical knee; along with Speaker Carl Heastie, who formerly [cancelled](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/nyregion/mamdani-record-albany-mayor.html) the democratic socialist’s bus pilot.\n- Zohran Mamdani’s brilliance is that, amidst a sea of aloof Democratic leadership, he not only understands this dynamic, but speaks to it. Mamdani began his campaign, in the days after Trump’s victory, talking to voters on Fordham Road in the Bronx and Hillside Avenue in Queens; local working-class constituencies the Democratic Party had forgotten. His victory was not solely a triumph of _The Commie Corridor_, but under-represented and oft-overlooked New Yorkers: [Muslims](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/25/nyregion/nyc-voters-muslim-zohran-mamdani.html), [South Asians](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/25/nyregion/mamdani-south-asian-voters.html), rent-stabilized tenants.\n- Now, Zohran Mamdani has more endorsements than the rest of the field _combined_— several times over. And, while his opponents poll numbers have flatlined, Mamdani’s have steadily risen, on pace to exceed fifty-percent. Inevitably, the day-to-day contours of Mamdani’s campaign, when compared to the Democratic Primary, is different. His team, once a scrappy cadre of underdogs, has grown to more than two dozen.\n\n### Content\n# [The Narrative Wars](https://www.michaellange.nyc/)\n\nSubscribeSign in\n\n# Zohran is Inevitable\n\n### But can Mamdani keep the Magic?\n\n[Michael Lange](https://substack.com/@michaellangenyc)\n\nSep 25, 2025\n\n61\n\n[19](https://www.michaellange.nyc/p/zohran-is-inevitable/comments)\n9\n\n[Share](javascript:void(0))\n\nOn November 4th, Zohran Mamdani will be elected the next Mayor of New York City.\n\nSince the night of June 24th, Mamdani has become one of the most acclaimed — and polarizing — politicians in the nation. A brief sojourn to Uganda to celebrate his nuptials did not interrupt the hype. Much of the Democratic establishment, quietly impressed throughout the Primary, has flocked to Mamdani. Even Governor Kathy Hochul, an Upstate moderate, bent the metaphorical knee; along with Speaker Carl Heastie, who formerly [cancelled](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/nyregion/mamdani-record-albany-mayor.html) the democratic socialist’s bus pilot. A phone call with Barack Obama was reported by _[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/13/opinion/mamdani-obama-democrats.html)_. All sectors of the political press — local, national, international — clamor for Mamdani-mentum. Magazine covers bear his warm smile, with even more profiles in waiting. _Socialism_ and _Affordability_ are en vogue; their champion praised as a [model](https://www.michaellange.nyc/p/the-mamdani-model) for the Democratic Party. He is not only the talk of this town of almost nine million, but the United States of America.\n\nDespite Mamdani’s twelve point victory in the Democratic Primary, none of this was guaranteed. In the weeks thereafter, the billionaire class, caught flat footed in June, foreshadowed a tidal wave of outside spending come November, while scheming to narrow the field down to two. However, three months later, their efforts have flopped. Mayor Eric Adams, doomed to single digits, has remained in the race, content to attack Andrew Cuomo, the only candidate with a prayer of upsetting Mam\n\n---\n\n## Source 5: And ultimately – Zohran Mamdani stuns New York\nURL: https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2025/06/and-ultimately-zohran-mamdani-stuns-new-york/406293/?oref=csny-topic-lander-river\nPublished: 2025-06-25T03:12:31.000Z\nAuthor: Annie McDonough, Sahalie Donaldson\n\n### Summary\nZohran Mamdani has made a significant impact in the 2025 New York City mayoral race, emerging as the Democratic primary winner against former Governor Andrew Cuomo. As of election night, Mamdani held a 7-point lead in first-choice votes, securing 43.5% compared to Cuomo's 36.4%. His victory marks a historic upset, as he transformed from an unknown candidate to a formidable contender backed by a grassroots movement and the Democratic Socialists of America. While the final results will depend on ranked-choice voting, political analysts suggest that Mamdani's lead makes it unlikely for Cuomo to catch up. Mamdani's progressive platform and ability to engage younger voters have been pivotal to his success.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- In an election night showing more decisive than even his most optimistic supporters dared to dream of, Zohran Mamdani toppled a political Goliath Tuesday. As of 10 p.m., the 33-year-old insurgent candidate held a strong 7-point lead in first-choice voters over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary for mayor. “My friends, we have done it,” Mamdani said just a little after midnight, addressing supporters at a packed campaign party in Long Island City, Queens.\n- Leading up to election day, there was a groundswell of support in his favor, drawn to his economic populist message, charisma, positivity and creative social media strategy. And his support was ultimately not limited to young gentrifier types in brownstone Brooklyn and lower Manhattan. On election night, he appeared to have a lead in areas of eastern Queens and central and southern Brooklyn as well as northern Manhattan – all regions previously unwelcoming to leftist candidates.It was this \"unprecedented coalition” Mamdani spoke of Tuesday night.\n- Much still looms. The primary election is not necessarily the end of the mayoral race this year. In many ways, it’s a preview for the November general election, which could have five major candidates on the ballot. Adams, buoyed by the dismissal of his federal charges and hellbent on redemption, will be on the ballot as an independent as will the well-funded lawyer Jim Walden.\n\n### Content\n[Skip to Content](https://www.cityandstateny.com/www.cityandstateny.com#main)\n\nBy [Annie McDonough](https://www.cityandstateny.com/voices/annie-mcdonough/17228/?oref=csny-post-author?oref=rf-post-author) and [Sahalie Donaldson](https://www.cityandstateny.com/voices/sahalie-donaldson/17565/?oref=csny-post-author?oref=rf-post-author)\n\n\\| June 24, 2025\n\nBy [Annie McDonough](https://www.cityandstateny.com/voices/annie-mcdonough/17228/?oref=csny-post-author?oref=rf-post-author) and [Sahalie Donaldson](https://www.cityandstateny.com/voices/sahalie-donaldson/17565/?oref=csny-post-author?oref=rf-post-author)\n\nJune 24, 2025\n\n- [2025 New York City Mayoral Election](https://www.cityandstateny.com/topic/2025-New-York-City-Mayoral-Election/?oref=csny-article-topics)\n- [Campaigns & Elections](https://www.cityandstateny.com/topic/campaigns-elections/?oref=csny-article-topics)\n- [News & Politics](https://www.cityandstateny.com/topic/news-politics/?oref=csny-article-topics)\n- [New York City](https://www.cityandstateny.com/topic/new-york-city/?oref=csny-article-topics)\n\nIn an election night showing more decisive than even his most optimistic supporters dared to dream of, Zohran Mamdani toppled a political Goliath Tuesday.

His main rivals, former Governor Andrew Cuomo and GOP nominee Curtis Sliwa, trail significantly, with Cuomo at 22% and Sliwa at 13%. The poll indicates that even if Cuomo or Mayor Eric Adams were to drop out and endorse each other, they would still not come close to Mamdani's support. Notably, about 60% of voters would never consider Cuomo, and 68% feel the same about Adams, highlighting the challenges they face.

### Summary
Zohran Mamdani has a strong chance of winning the 2025 New York City mayoral election, particularly after his recent primary victory over Andrew Cuomo. Current predictions suggest he has a 72% chance of winning, compared to Eric Adams' 21%. While Mamdani's support primarily comes from younger voters and progressive groups, the election outcome will depend on how the broader electorate perceives him compared to other candidates. 

Adams, who chose not to participate in the Democratic primary, may face Mamdani as an independent candidate in the general election. Although Mamdani's victory seems likely, it is not guaranteed, with a 30-40% chance of an alternative scenario where Adams could win if certain conditions align. Overall, while Mamdani's prospects look favorable, the election remains competitive.

### Key Highlights

A good chance, but not a slam dunk. Mamdanis’s primary upset over Cuomo has thrown the race into a tizzy. Since his support is primarily from younger voters and the Progressive left, combined with the Asian and Muslim communities, everyone else is currently assessing the situation. The outcome will ultimately hinge on how terrified the rest of the city is about having Mamdani in office compared to literally anyone else. Here is the most likely alternative scenario to a Mamdani win: Cuomo does not run as an independent Trump appoints Sliwa to some federal position (ambassador, homeland security, etc.) Sliwa moves out of state, thus dropping from the ballot The Republ

### Summary
The article discusses Zohran Mamdani's potential impact on American politics, particularly in the context of his candidacy for the 2025 NYC mayoral election. It highlights his unique approach, contrasting him with traditional Democratic candidates. Mamdani, who has garnered support from a diverse coalition, including poor immigrants, aims to inspire a new vision for the Democratic Party, reminiscent of the liberalism of the 1960s. His ability to connect with voters and his desire to stand out in a party often dominated by older figures may position him favorably in the upcoming election. However, the article also notes the historical distrust between certain communities and candidates like Mamdani, which could influence his chances. Overall, while Mamdani shows promise, the outcome of the election will depend on various factors, including voter sentiment and campaign dynamics.

### Key Highlights
- And in all this time there has only been a handful, if that, of politicians who have inspired as much hope for a new Democratic vision as Zohran Mamdani. Mamdani pronounces his first name with a slightly aspirated _h_ and emphasis on the second syllable. It’s a pronunciation he came to favor over the more casual “ _Zoh_-ran” amid a long process of becoming “confident in who I am and where I come from,” as he would put it, which shapes much of his story.
- He also had a fervent base of support from a bloc of poor immigrants whose values and religion had long been seen as dangerous, alien, and simply un-American. Then he transcended that base. By the time the general election came around, it was hard to imagine that anyone else could have been the nominee. It was 1960, the year Lyndon Baines Johnson lost the Democratic presidential primary to [John Fitzgerald Kennedy](https://www.vanityfair.com/topic/john-f-kennedy?srsltid=AfmBOoq8CYnAJjBRavqmQ_5Ph2O-yLxjtDQuqBBHG7k-ZBYsH4GhaExr).
- Late this past August, [Zohran Mamdani](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/john-catsimatidis-on-zohran-mamdani?srsltid=AfmBOopNAXyAINHQvyMFw4mRyjZuphzjAB9uXaJ3YO7SfJ8RxVql31ti) took in a service at the First Baptist Church of Crown Heights, a Black church on Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn. The congregation moved into its current location not long after Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, a year that looks in retrospect like the high-water mark of American liberalism, before the riots of ’68, the spiraling of the New Left into radical terrorism, Reagan and the shattering of the Democratic coalition, Trump and a new turn among conservatives against the philosophy of liberalism itself.

It was the primary fight that changed the course of the [Democratic Party](https://www.vanityfair.com/topic/democratic-party?srsltid=AfmBOoo894UdoP4jL9XWxfj1xOj-7gsOZIRMZ7cVQUaOSV7G_9wRooaC). A craggy-faced master of insider politics squared off against a suave and handsome upstart, whose youth and relative inexperience masked the fact that he had a very hard-nosed understanding of machine politics. The older man was confident. He sat back and quietly logged support from party dons, donors, insiders. He would step in when the moment was right.

The younger man campaigned at a pace that seemed to test his physical limits. He and his network of supporters badgered every ward heeler and union boss who would listen, often with a simple request that they agree to meet the candidate. Because if you met the candidate, you would be charmed, sure, but you would also learn that he was very serious about this thing, that he intended to win, and that he had plans for what he’d do when he did. He also had a fervent base of support from a bloc of poor immigrants whose values and religion had long been seen as dangerous, alien, and simply un-American. Then he transcended that base.

### Summary
Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist and state assemblyman, has rapidly gained prominence in the lead-up to the 2025 NYC mayoral election, transforming from a little-known figure to a leading candidate. His political style resonates with many progressives, focusing on principled, pocketbook issues and leveraging online platforms to connect with voters. While he is seen as a fresh voice with innovative ideas, his lack of experience compared to predecessors raises questions about his ability to govern effectively. The outcome of his candidacy will be pivotal for the Democratic Party's future, as it could either restore faith in government or reinforce skepticism among voters nationwide. Whether he will win the election remains uncertain, but his rise has certainly made him a significant contender.

[Time](https://time.com/7308924/zohran-mamdani-interview-time/): “Before 2025, basically no one knew who Mamdani was. Over the course of eight months, the democratic socialist and backbench state assemblyman went from local long shot to likely mayor of America’s biggest city. Suddenly he is a main character in national politics—the ubiquitous subject of cable news segments, a lightning rod on the left and right… To many progressives, his style of politics—principled, pocketbook-focused, and online—was an electrifying answer for a moribund party.”

“He is a very eloquent, very young man who is both less experienced than his predecessors and more gifted than almost any of his peers at connecting with the party’s voters. He is an ideologue interested in creative solutions, less radical than painted when you dig into his policy proposals and yet more sincere in his left-wing ambitions. He is a movement politician who won by being in touch with the streets, and who must now cloister himself inside as he prepares for the business of governing, not betraying the people by not failing them…”

“How the nation’s financial and cultural capital fares under his leadership would be Exhibit A in the fight for the Democrats’ future. At stake is the trust of voters thousands of miles from Midtown, for whom Mamdani would be a test case—another failed figurehead of a major Democratic city, or the leader who can get people believing in government again.”

### Summary
Zohran Mamdani is poised to win the 2025 New York City mayoral election, with a significant lead following his twelve-point victory in the Democratic Primary. His popularity has surged, attracting endorsements from key political figures and a growing base of support. Despite potential challenges from opponents like Andrew Cuomo and Eric Adams, Mamdani's campaign momentum appears strong, with polling indicating he may exceed fifty percent of the vote. The article discusses the evolution of his campaign and the political dynamics at play, suggesting that Mamdani's victory is increasingly likely as the election date approaches.

### Key Highlights
- Since the night of June 24th, Mamdani has become one of the most acclaimed — and polarizing — politicians in the nation. A brief sojourn to Uganda to celebrate his nuptials did not interrupt the hype. Much of the Democratic establishment, quietly impressed throughout the Primary, has flocked to Mamdani. Even Governor Kathy Hochul, an Upstate moderate, bent the metaphorical knee; along with Speaker Carl Heastie, who formerly [cancelled](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/nyregion/mamdani-record-albany-mayor.html) the democratic socialist’s bus pilot.
- Zohran Mamdani’s brilliance is that, amidst a sea of aloof Democratic leadership, he not only understands this dynamic, but speaks to it. Mamdani began his campaign, in the days after Trump’s victory, talking to voters on Fordham Road in the Bronx and Hillside Avenue in Queens; local working-class constituencies the Democratic Party had forgotten. His victory was not solely a triumph of _The Commie Corridor_, but under-represented and oft-overlooked New Yorkers: [Muslims](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/25/nyregion/nyc-voters-muslim-zohran-mamdani.html), [South Asians](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/25/nyregion/mamdani-south-asian-voters.html), rent-stabilized tenants.
- Now, Zohran Mamdani has more endorsements than the rest of the field _combined_— several times over. And, while his opponents poll numbers have flatlined, Mamdani’s have steadily risen, on pace to exceed fifty-percent. Inevitably, the day-to-day contours of Mamdani’s campaign, when compared to the Democratic Primary, is different. His team, once a scrappy cadre of underdogs, has grown to more than two dozen.

On November 4th, Zohran Mamdani will be elected the next Mayor of New York City.

Since the night of June 24th, Mamdani has become one of the most acclaimed — and polarizing — politicians in the nation. A brief sojourn to Uganda to celebrate his nuptials did not interrupt the hype. Much of the Democratic establishment, quietly impressed throughout the Primary, has flocked to Mamdani. Even Governor Kathy Hochul, an Upstate moderate, bent the metaphorical knee; along with Speaker Carl Heastie, who formerly [cancelled](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/nyregion/mamdani-record-albany-mayor.html) the democratic socialist’s bus pilot. A phone call with Barack Obama was reported by _[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/13/opinion/mamdani-obama-democrats.html)_. All sectors of the political press — local, national, international — clamor for Mamdani-mentum. Magazine covers bear his warm smile, with even more profiles in waiting. _Socialism_ and _Affordability_ are en vogue; their champion praised as a [model](https://www.michaellange.nyc/p/the-mamdani-model) for the Democratic Party. He is not only the talk of this town of almost nine million, but the United States of America.

Despite Mamdani’s twelve point victory in the Democratic Primary, none of this was guaranteed. In the weeks thereafter, the billionaire class, caught flat footed in June, foreshadowed a tidal wave of outside spending come November, while scheming to narrow the field down to two. However, three months later, their efforts have flopped. Mayor Eric Adams, doomed to single digits, has remained in the race, content to attack Andrew Cuomo, the only candidate with a prayer of upsetting Mam

### Summary
Zohran Mamdani has made a significant impact in the 2025 New York City mayoral race, emerging as the Democratic primary winner against former Governor Andrew Cuomo. As of election night, Mamdani held a 7-point lead in first-choice votes, securing 43.5% compared to Cuomo's 36.4%. His victory marks a historic upset, as he transformed from an unknown candidate to a formidable contender backed by a grassroots movement and the Democratic Socialists of America. While the final results will depend on ranked-choice voting, political analysts suggest that Mamdani's lead makes it unlikely for Cuomo to catch up. Mamdani's progressive platform and ability to engage younger voters have been pivotal to his success.

### Key Highlights
- In an election night showing more decisive than even his most optimistic supporters dared to dream of, Zohran Mamdani toppled a political Goliath Tuesday. As of 10 p.m., the 33-year-old insurgent candidate held a strong 7-point lead in first-choice voters over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary for mayor. “My friends, we have done it,” Mamdani said just a little after midnight, addressing supporters at a packed campaign party in Long Island City, Queens.
- Leading up to election day, there was a groundswell of support in his favor, drawn to his economic populist message, charisma, positivity and creative social media strategy. And his support was ultimately not limited to young gentrifier types in brownstone Brooklyn and lower Manhattan. On election night, he appeared to have a lead in areas of eastern Queens and central and southern Brooklyn as well as northern Manhattan – all regions previously unwelcoming to leftist candidates.It was this "unprecedented coalition” Mamdani spoke of Tuesday night.
- Much still looms. The primary election is not necessarily the end of the mayoral race this year. In many ways, it’s a preview for the November general election, which could have five major candidates on the ballot. Adams, buoyed by the dismissal of his federal charges and hellbent on redemption, will be on the ballot as an independent as will the well-funded lawyer Jim Walden.

### Summary
The article discusses the shifting dynamics of the 2025 NYC mayoral race, particularly focusing on Zohran Mamdani's emerging coalition and Eric Adams' unexpected opportunity for a political comeback following Andrew Cuomo's recent loss. Adams, who faced significant challenges due to low approval ratings and a federal corruption indictment, may benefit from the changing political landscape. While the article does not provide a definitive answer regarding Mamdani's chances of winning, it highlights the competitive nature of the race and the potential for Adams to regain support amidst Mamdani's rise.

### Key Highlights

### Summary
Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee and current front-runner for the 2025 NYC mayoral election, is projected to win decisively with 50% of likely voters supporting him, according to a recent poll by Zenith Research/Public Progress Solutions. His main rivals, former Governor Andrew Cuomo and GOP nominee Curtis Sliwa, trail significantly, with Cuomo at 22% and Sliwa at 13%. The poll indicates that even if Cuomo or Mayor Eric Adams were to drop out and endorse each other, they would still not come close to Mamdani's support. Notably, about 60% of voters would never consider Cuomo, and 68% feel the same about Adams, highlighting the challenges they face. Overall, the data strongly suggests that Mamdani is well-positioned to win the election.

Mamdani, a Queens assemblyman and the Democratic nominee, is projected to handily win the November general election with 50% of likely voters in the latest survey, released Tuesday by Zenith Research/Public Progress Solutions.
- Ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has [decided to continue his comeback tour](https://www.aol.com/news/andrew-cuomo-confirms-independent-run-192842321.html) after his embarrassing June primary loss to 33-year-old Mamdani, came in a distant second at 22%, while GOP nominee Curtis Sliwa pulled 13%. Mayor Eric Adams, who bailed on the Democratic Party line after his historic corruption case took months for the Trump administration to kill, failed to muster more than 7% support.
- About 60% of likely voters said they would never consider voting for Cuomo, while 68% of those polled said Adams will never be their choice come November. And Mamdani would win with 51% if Adams drops from the race, with Cuomo only netting 25% in the scenario and Sliwa receiving 15%, according to the poll.

Zohran Mamdani has won the Democratic primary for mayor of New York City, positioning him as the frontrunner for the upcoming general election. His campaign focused on affordability and resonated particularly with younger voters, despite facing accusations of anti-Semitism from his opponent, Andrew Cuomo. The primary results indicate a shift among Democrats towards new leadership, suggesting Mamdani could potentially win the mayoral election in 2025. His victory is seen as a significant moment for the Democratic party and may present challenges for Republican candidates.

### Key Highlights
- A young, formerly unknown democratic socialist won the Democratic primary for mayor of New York City, making him the frontrunner to be its next leader. Zohran Mamdani focused relentlessly on affordability while young voters rallied around his cheerful vibe and pro-Palestinian politics. His veteran opponent Andrew Cuomo accused him of anti-Semitism — the city has more Jews than anywhere outside Israel — but conceded after what The New York Times called a “ [joyless](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/25/nyregion/mamdani-speech-watch-party.html)” campaign.
- The result showed that Democrats appeared ready “ [to throw off old leaders,](https://www.semafor.com/article/06/23/2025/new-york-city-democrats-mamdani-socialist-cuomo)” as Semafor’s David Weigel put it. With New York’s mayor running a budget comparable to that of a medium-sized country, Mamdani’s victory makes him “ [the great new bogeyman](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/zohran-mamdani-remade-american-politics-in-nyc-mayor-race.html)” for the Republican party, New York Magazine reported.
