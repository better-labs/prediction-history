- Confidence: 97%
- AI Prediction Delta: 1.55%

### Key Factors
- 22nd Amendment term limits prohibit a third presidential election victory for Trump
- Trump has already been elected twice (2016 and 2024), triggering the term limit constraint
- Market resolution requires AP/Fox/NBC to call a winner or default to the inaugurated president; an ineligible candidate will not be called
- Ballotpedia’s 2028 context highlights other potential contenders, not Trump (consistent with ineligibility)
- Candidate-agnostic projections (AmericanPresidents.net) cannot imply Trump’s victory
- Tiny tail risk of constitutional amendment or unprecedented legal change before 2028

### Outcome Reasoning
(1) Constitutional ineligibility due to term limits. The 22nd Amendment bars anyone from being elected president more than twice. Donald Trump has already been elected in 2016 and 2024, making him ineligible to be elected in 2028. This ineligibility is reflected in public-facing references noting he cannot run in 2028 due to term limits [Source 4: Simple Wikipedia, 2025-03-30]. The broader public discussion of "third-term" speculation underscores that this is a known constraint, not an open question [Source 6: Wikipedia timeline referencing NBC News, 2025-05-04].

(2) Market resolution mechanics and practical ballot access. The market resolves to AP, Fox News, and NBC calling the same winner, or to the person inaugurated on January 20, 2029 if no consensus call occurs. An ineligible candidate will not be placed on ballots or called as the election winner by major networks under standard U.S. election practice. Therefore, Trump cannot be the called winner under the stated resolution criteria.

(3) 2028 field context does not include Trump as a plausible contender. Ballotpedia’s overview of the 2028 election timeline and early candidate chatter focuses on other potential contenders, with no credible pathway for Trump being a candidate due to term limits [Source 2: Ballotpedia, 2024-11-05].

(4) Projections do not imply a Trump pathway. A 2028 projection that is strictly candidate-agnostic suggests a potential Republican victory but explicitly does not consider who the candidate is [Source 3: AmericanPresidents.net, 2024-12-16]. Even if the GOP wins, this does not translate to Trump winning, given his ineligibility.

(5) Tail-risk scenarios are extraordinarily remote. Only a highly unlikely constitutional amendment or unprecedented legal reinterpretation could enable a third election victory for Trump before 2028, and no credible movement toward such a change is evidenced in the research set. Prior media speculation from 2023–2024 about 2028 prospects predated the 2024 result and does not supersede the constitutional term limit reality post-2024 [Grok Results 1–10].

### Confidence Reasoning
(1) Strong legal foundation and cross-source alignment. The central determinant is a constitutional rule (22nd Amendment) that is well-settled. While the research corpus here does not include the text of the amendment, multiple sources align on the practical implication that Trump is ineligible in 2028 (e.g., Source 4; Source 6 indicates mainstream coverage of third-term limits). This provides a robust basis for high confidence.

(2) Consistency with election process and media calls. The resolution criteria (AP/Fox/NBC calling the winner or inauguration) are incompatible with calling an ineligible candidate. This procedural certainty boosts confidence.

(3) Residual uncertainty is minimal but nonzero. The main uncertainty would be an extraordinary, rapid constitutional amendment or unprecedented judicial/legislative action enabling a third election victory. No evidence in the research indicates such a trajectory. Given the long time horizon, a small residual is retained.

(4) Data caveats and quality. While Simple Wikipedia (Source 4) is less authoritative, it reflects an uncontroversial constitutional fact. Ballotpedia (Source 2) is generally reliable for election timelines and context. The projection site (Source 3) is transparent about being candidate-agnostic. Some Grok links are dated and speculative; they do not contradict the core legal constraint. Hence, confidence is very high but not absolute.

Data Quality: MEDIUM

The projection forecasts a Republican victory with 297 electoral votes, 30 of 50 states carried, and 76,577,818 popular votes (49.2%). The Democrat is projected to receive 241 electoral votes, carrying 21 states plus D.C., with 78,943,575 popular votes (50.8%).

The 22nd Amendment bars anyone from being elected president more than twice. Donald Trump has already been elected in 2016 and 2024, making him ineligible to be elected in 2028. This ineligibility is reflected in public-facing references noting he cannot run in 2028 due to term limits [Source 4: Simple Wikipedia, 2025-03-30]. The broader public discussion of \\\"third-term\\\" speculation underscores that this is a known constraint, not an open question [Source 6: Wikipedia timeline referencing NBC News, 2025-05-04].\\n\\n(2) Market resolution mechanics and practical ballot access. The market resolves to AP, Fox News, and NBC calling the same winner, or to the person inaugurated on January 20, 2029 if no consensus call occurs. An ineligible candidate will not be placed on ballots or called as the election winner by major networks under standard U.S. election practice. Therefore, Trump cannot be the called winner under the stated resolution criteria.\\n\\n(3) 2028 field context does not include Trump as a plausible contender. Ballotpedia’s overview of the 2028 election timeline and early candidate chatter focuses on other potential contenders, with no credible pathway for Trump being a candidate due to term limits [Source 2: Ballotpedia, 2024-11-05].\\n\\n(4) Projections do not imply a Trump pathway. A 2028 projection that is strictly candidate-agnostic suggests a potential Republican victory but explicitly does not consider who the candidate is [Source 3: AmericanPresidents.net, 2024-12-16]. Even if the GOP wins, this does not translate to Trump winning, given his ineligibility.\\n\\n(5) Tail-risk scenarios are extraordinarily remote. Only a highly unlikely constitutional amendment or unprecedented legal reinterpretation could enable a third election victory for Trump before 2028, and no credible movement toward such a change is evidenced in the research set. Prior media speculation from 2023–2024 about 2028 prospects predated the 2024 result and does not supersede the constitutional term limit reality post-2024 [Grok Results 1–10].\",\n    \"confidence\": 97,\n    \"confidenceReasoning\": \"(1) Strong legal foundation and cross-source alignment. The central determinant is a constitutional rule (22nd Amendment) that is well-settled. While the research corpus here does not include the text of the amendment, multiple sources align on the practical implication that Trump is ineligible in 2028 (e.g., Source 4; Source 6 indicates mainstream coverage of third-term limits). This provides a robust basis for high confidence.\\n\\n(2) Consistency with election process and media calls. The resolution criteria (AP/Fox/NBC calling the winner or inauguration) are incompatible with calling an ineligible candidate. This procedural certainty boosts confidence.\\n\\n(3) Residual uncertainty is minimal but nonzero. The main uncertainty would be an extraordinary, rapid constitutional amendment or unprecedented judicial/legislative action enabling a third election victory. No evidence in the research indicates such a trajectory. Given the long time horizon, a small residual is retained.\\n\\n(4) Data caveats and quality. While Simple Wikipedia (Source 4) is less authoritative, it reflects an uncontroversial constitutional fact. Ballotpedia (Source 2) is generally reliable for election timelines and context. The projection site (Source 3) is transparent about being candidate-agnostic. Some Grok links are dated and speculative; they do not contradict the core legal constraint.

    "question": "Will Donald Trump win the 2028 US Presidential Election?",
    "prediction": {
      "outcome": "NO",
      "outcomeReasoning": "(1) Constitutional ineligibility due to term limits. The 22nd Amendment bars anyone from being elected president more than twice. Donald Trump has already been elected in 2016 and 2024, making him ineligible to be elected in 2028. This ineligibility is reflected in public-facing references noting he cannot run in 2028 due to term limits [Source 4: Simple Wikipedia, 2025-03-30]. The broader public discussion of \"third-term\" speculation underscores that this is a known constraint, not an open question [Source 6: Wikipedia timeline referencing NBC News, 2025-05-04].\n\n(2) Market resolution mechanics and practical ballot access. The market resolves to AP, Fox News, and NBC calling the same winner, or to the person inaugurated on January 20, 2029 if no consensus call occurs. An ineligible candidate will not be placed on ballots or called as the election winner by major networks under standard U.S. election practice. Therefore, Trump cannot be the called winner under the stated resolution criteria.\n\n(3) 2028 field context does not include Trump as a plausible contender. Ballotpedia’s overview of the 2028 election timeline and early candidate chatter focuses on other potential contenders, with no credible pathway for Trump being a candidate due to term limits [Source 2: Ballotpedia, 2024-11-05].\n\n(4) Projections do not imply a Trump pathway. A 2028 projection that is strictly candidate-agnostic suggests a potential Republican victory but explicitly does not consider who the candidate is [Source 3: AmericanPresidents.net, 2024-12-16]. Even if the GOP wins, this does not translate to Trump winning, given his ineligibility.\n\n(5) Tail-risk scenarios are extraordinarily remote. Only a highly unlikely constitutional amendment or unprecedented legal reinterpretation could enable a third election victory for Trump before 2028, and no credible movement toward such a change is evidenced in the research set. Prior media speculation from 2023–2024 about 2028 prospects predated the 2024 result and does not supersede the constitutional term limit reality post-2024 [Grok Results 1–10].",
      "confidence": 97,
      "confidenceReasoning": "(1) Strong legal foundation and cross-source alignment. The central determinant is a constitutional rule (22nd Amendment) that is well-settled. While the research corpus here does not include the text of the amendment, multiple sources align on the practical implication that Trump is ineligible in 2028 (e.g., Source 4; Source 6 indicates mainstream coverage of third-term limits). This provides a robust basis for high confidence.\n\n(2) Consistency with election process and media calls. The resolution criteria (AP/Fox/NBC calling the winner or inauguration) are incompatible with calling an ineligible candidate. This procedural certainty boosts confidence.\n\n(3) Residual uncertainty is minimal but nonzero. The main uncertainty would be an extraordinary, rapid constitutional amendment or unprecedented judicial/legislative action enabling a third election victory. No evidence in the research indicates such a trajectory. Given the long time horizon, a small residual is retained.\n\n(4) Data caveats and quality. While Simple Wikipedia (Source 4) is less authoritative, it reflects an uncontroversial constitutional fact. Ballotpedia (Source 2) is generally reliable for election timelines and context. The projection site (Source 3) is transparent about being candidate-agnostic. Some Grok links are dated and speculative; they do not contradict the core legal constraint. Hence, confidence is very high but not absolute.",

The projection forecasts a Republican victory with 297 electoral votes, 30 of 50 states carried, and 76,577,818 popular votes (49.2%).

The 22nd Amendment bars anyone from being elected president more than twice. Donald Trump has already been elected in 2016 and 2024, making him ineligible to be elected in 2028. This ineligibility is reflected in public-facing references noting he cannot run in 2028 due to term limits [Source 4: Simple Wikipedia, 2025-03-30]. The broader public discussion of \\\"third-term\\\" speculation underscores that this is a known constraint, not an open question [Source 6: Wikipedia timeline referencing NBC News, 2025-05-04].\\n\\n(2) Market resolution mechanics and practical ballot access. The market resolves to AP, Fox News, and NBC calling the same winner, or to the person inaugurated on January 20, 2029 if no consensus call occurs. An ineligible candidate will not be placed on ballots or called as the election winner by major networks under standard U.S. election practice. Therefore, Trump cannot be the called winner under the stated resolution criteria.\\n\\n(3) 2028 field context does not include Trump as a plausible contender. Ballotpedia’s overview of the 2028 election timeline and early candidate chatter focuses on other potential contenders, with no credible pathway for Trump being a candidate due to term limits [Source 2: Ballotpedia, 2024-11-05].\\n\\n(4) Projections do not imply a Trump pathway. A 2028 projection that is strictly candidate-agnostic suggests a potential Republican victory but explicitly does not consider who the candidate is [Source 3: AmericanPresidents.net, 2024-12-16]. Even if the GOP wins, this does not translate to Trump winning, given his ineligibility.\\n\\n(5) Tail-risk scenarios are extraordinarily remote. Only a highly unlikely constitutional amendment or unprecedented legal reinterpretation could enable a third election victory for Trump before 2028, and no credible movement toward such a change is evidenced in the research set. Prior media speculation from 2023–2024 about 2028 prospects predated the 2024 result and does not supersede the constitutional term limit reality post-2024 [Grok Results 1–10].\",\n    \"confidence\": 97,\n    \"confidenceReasoning\": \"(1) Strong legal foundation and cross-source alignment. The central determinant is a constitutional rule (22nd Amendment) that is well-settled. While the research corpus here does not include the text of the amendment, multiple sources align on the practical implication that Trump is ineligible in 2028 (e.g., Source 4; Source 6 indicates mainstream coverage of third-term limits). This provides a robust basis for high confidence.\\n\\n(2) Consistency with election process and media calls. The resolution criteria (AP/Fox/NBC calling the winner or inauguration) are incompatible with calling an ineligible candidate. This procedural certainty boosts confidence.\\n\\n(3) Residual uncertainty is minimal but nonzero. The main uncertainty would be an extraordinary, rapid constitutional amendment or unprecedented judicial/legislative action enabling a third election victory. No evidence in the research indicates such a trajectory. Given the long time horizon, a small residual is retained.\\n\\n(4) Data caveats and quality. While Simple Wikipedia (Source 4) is less authoritative, it reflects an uncontroversial constitutional fact. Ballotpedia (Source 2) is generally reliable for election timelines and context. The projection site (Source 3) is transparent about being candidate-agnostic. Some Grok links are dated and speculative; they do not contradict the core legal constraint.

Published: 2024-12-16T00:00:00.000Z

### Summary
This website provides a by-the-numbers projection for the 2028 U.S. Presidential Election, released on December 16, 2024. It attempts to predict the winner based on the voting data from the 2016, 2020, and 2024 election cycles, without considering the actual candidates or voter psychology. The projection forecasts a Republican victory with 297 electoral votes, 30 of 50 states carried, and 76,577,818 popular votes (49.2%). The Democrat is projected to receive 241 electoral votes, carrying 21 states plus D.C., with 78,943,575 popular votes (50.8%). The website does not mention Donald Trump.


### Key Highlights
- With these results online since 12/16/2024, the AmericanPresidents.net experimental 2028 forecast predicts, to the final popular vote being cast, the results of the upcoming U.S. Presidential Election. The projection does not take into account who the actual Republican and Democrat candidates were going to be, instead attempting to define the winner based purely on the numbers behind the vote by state recorded over the last three Presidential Election cycles (2016, 2020, 2024).Note that these results are strictly a by-the-numbers approach without knowing who the candidates for either side are going to be as of December 2024 or what voter psychology will be going into the 2028 election season.
