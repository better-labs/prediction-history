- AI Prediction Delta: 0.50%

### Key Factors
- GOP majority control of the House during the entire 119th Congress (2025–2026), limiting prospects for passage of impeachment articles (Source 7).
- H.Res.353 remains at Introduced status with no House adoption; only a notice of intent to offer as a privileged resolution was recorded (Sources 1, 6).
- Procedural ability of the House majority to table or refer privileged impeachment resolutions, preventing passage even if introduced (general House practice; reflected in Sources 1, 6 procedural notes).
- Timing: Any partisan shift from the 2026 midterms would not take effect until January 2027, outside the market window (structural calendar constraint).
- Lack of evidence for bipartisan momentum or committee/floor movement toward adoption during the eligibility period (Source 3 corroborates absence of passage).
- Historical rarity of bipartisan impeachments absent overwhelming consensus or crisis, especially under unified partisan control opposed to impeachment (context from Source 7).

The first impeachment focused on allegations of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress related to his dealings with Ukraine, while the second impeachment was prompted by the January 6 Capitol riot, accusing him of incitement of insurrection. Both impeachments resulted in acquittals by the Senate. \n\nRegarding your query about whether Trump will be impeached by the end of 2026, the resolution of related markets hinges on whether the House of Representatives will pass articles of impeachment against him by a specified date. The page does not provide future predictions or outcomes but details the historical context and processes of impeachment.

Looking back, these are the things I wish I’d done sooner. 1. Your home equity is a gold mine - tap into it instead of getting a loan A lot of people turn to high-interest payday loans when they need cash (please don’t). If you own a home, you might have a much better option: a home equity line of credit ( HELOC). A HELOC lets you borrow against the equity in your house - kind of like a credit card, but with lower interest rates and more flexible repayment terms than most traditional loans. It’s often one of the cheapest ways to borrow money when you really need it. If you’re curious, here’s a calculator to see how much you might be able to get: link here. 2. Compare auto insurance companies every 6-12 months. If you haven’t compared auto insurance offers in the last 6 months, you’re probably overspending (on average by ~$460/year ¹). Example: I finally shopped around and ended up saving ~$1,300 this year by switching carriers for the exact same coverage. It took me about 5 minutes. Seriously, just check a comparison site (I used Coverage.com, but Auto-Savings.com works too). You’ll get multiple offers in one go, and worst case? You stay with what you’ve got. Best case? You save a few hundred bucks a year. Here’s a link to a decent comparison site: link. 3. Stop getting price gouged when you shop online.

Trump's advisers are reportedly taking the threat seriously, especially given that he is the only president to have been impeached twice. With significant changes already made to policies since his second term began, the urgency to push his agenda, including extending tax cuts set to expire at the end of 2025, has intensified. The administration is focused on passing crucial legislation before the midterms, as internal disagreements among Republicans pose challenges. The article highlights the high stakes involved, particularly in light of the looming possibility of impeachment proceedings if Democrats secure a majority.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Return to Homepage](https://www.yahoo.com)\n\n## Top Stories:\n\n- [Senate reaches shutdown deal](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/senators-near-deal-reopen-government-200820963.html)\n- [Flight cancellations](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/thanksgiving-air-traffic-could-slow-163901620.html)\n- [SNAP benefits paused](https://\n\n### Content\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Return to Homepage](https://www.yahoo.com)\n\n## Top Stories:\n\n- [Senate reaches shutdown deal](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/senators-near-deal-reopen-government-200820963.html)\n- [Flight cancellations](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/thanksgiving-air-traffic-could-slow-163901620.html)\n- [SNAP benefits paused](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-administration-tells-states-undo-155333628.html)\n- [Trump talks healthcare](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-urges-lawmakers-healthcare-money-145631423.html)\n- [Abrego Garcia update](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-admin-moves-dissolve-ban-152533849.html)\n- [More flights canceled](https://www.yahoo.com/news/us/live/flights-canceled-at-40-us-airports-full-coverage-as-faa-cuts-to-air-traffic-take-effect-amid-government-shutdown-162954349.html)\n- [NASA's journey to Mars](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/next-mars-launch-window-2026-122601304.html)\n- [A record Arctic blast?](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/early-arctic-cold-snap-could-184000871.html)\n- [Senate works the weekend](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/senators-weekend-shutdown-republicans-democrats-050149827.html)\n- [Full SNAP payments paused](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-admin-asks-supreme-court-235859390.html)\n\nTrump team is already preparing for an impeachment fight in case Dems take control of the House in 2026\n\nMore\n\nYahoo is using AI to generate takeaways from this article.

Although the Republican majority in the House and Senate makes it unlikely for the impeachment effort to succeed, its introduction highlights ongoing political divisions. If impeachment articles were to pass, it would lead to a Senate trial, potentially impacting Trump's second term and the political landscape ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The Constitution allows for multiple impeachments, raising questions about the grounds for such actions. The article does not provide a definitive answer regarding whether Trump will be impeached by the end of 2026, but it outlines the conditions under which it could occur.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Latest\n[Full List of Democrats Who Voted to End Government Shutdown](https://www.newsweek.com/full-list-of-democrats-who-voted-to-end-government-shutdown-11019295)\n\n- Nation\n\n[News](https://www.newsweek.com/news) [Politics](https://www.newsweek.com/politics) [Tech](https://www.newsweek.com/technology) [Fact Check](https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check) [Person\n\n### Content\nLatest\n[Full List of Democrats Who Voted to End Government Shutdown](https://www.newsweek.com/full-list-of-democrats-who-voted-to-end-government-shutdown-11019295)\n\n- Nation\n\n[News](https://www.newsweek.com/news) [Politics](https://www.newsweek.com/politics) [Tech](https://www.newsweek.com/technology) [Fact Check](https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check) [Personal Finance](https://www.newsweek.com/personal-finance) [Automotive](https://www.newsweek.com/autos) [Sports](https://www.newsweek.com/sports) [Better Workplaces](https://www.newsweek.com/better-workplaces)\n\n- World\n\n[Russia-Ukraine](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/russia) [Middle East](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/middle-east) [China And Asia](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/china) [Better Planet](https://www.newsweek.com/better-planet) [All World News](https://www.newsweek.com/world)\n\n- Lifestyle\n\n[Family & Parenting](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/parenting) [Entertainment](https://www.newsweek.com/entertainment) [Travel](https://www.newsweek.com/travel) [Pets](https://www.newsweek.com/pets) [Relationships](https://www.newsweek.com/relationships) [Science](https://www.newsweek.com/tech-science) [Health](https://www.newsweek.com/health)\n\n- Opinion\n\n[My Turn](https://www.newsweek.com/my-turn) [All Opinion](https://www.newsweek.com/opinion)\n\n- Rankings\n\n[Health](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/health) [Finance](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/finance) [Products](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/products-\n\n---\n\n## Source 8: Impeach Trump 2025\nURL: https://csr.cs.uml.edu/impeach-trump-2025\nPublished: 2025-03-31T00:00:00.000Z\nAuthor: Ashley\n\n### Summary\nThe article discusses the potential for a second impeachment of former President Donald Trump in 2025, particularly in light of his actions during a possible second term. It highlights several factors that could lead to impeachment, including controversial policy decisions, allegations of financial misconduct, and foreign policy controversies.

This article delves into the implications and possibilities of such an event occurring once again in 2025, exploring the political landscape, legal intricacies, and potential outcomes. \n The Context of a Second Impeachment The year 2025 marks a significant juncture in American political history, as it coincides with the potential end of a second term for President Trump or the start of a new administration, should he be unseated. The idea of a second impeachment gains traction amidst the ongoing discussions and debates surrounding the legacy of the 45th President and the impact of his policies and actions on the nation. \n While the first impeachment trial, which occurred in early 2020, focused primarily on allegations of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, the prospect of a second impeachment would likely revolve around a different set of circumstances and charges. The specific events and actions leading up to such a scenario are impossible to predict with certainty, but several potential factors could contribute to a second impeachment effort. \n The Impact of Policy Decisions \n One key aspect that could trigger a renewed call for impeachment is the potential for controversial policy decisions made by President Trump during his second term.\n\n---\n\n# Grok Web Search Results\n\nThe following search results provide additional real-time context:\n\n## Result 1: Experts Weigh In: Could Trump Face Impeachment by 2026?\nURL: https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/15/politics/trump-impeachment-predictions-2026\nSource: CNN\nPublished: 2023-10-15T00:00:00Z\n\nPolitical analysts discuss the possibility of Donald Trump being impeached if he returns to office, citing ongoing legal battles and potential House dynamics.

The only formal vehicle identified in the record is H.Res.353, introduced April 28, 2025, which remains at \\\"Introduced\\\" status and was referred to the Judiciary Committee, with a May 13, 2025 notice of intent to offer as a privileged resolution but no adoption by the House to date. Primary sources: Congress.gov listing and actions for H.Res.353 (Source 1) and the authenticated text on govinfo.gov (Source 6).\\n\\n(2) Partisan control and procedural realities: Impeachment requires a simple majority vote in the House. Throughout the 119th Congress (2025–2026), Republicans hold the House majority, and the majority leadership can block, table, or refer a privileged impeachment resolution, preventing passage. Newsweek notes that a Republican majority in the House and Senate makes a third impeachment effort unlikely to succeed (Source 7). With GOP control, cross-party defections sufficient to pass articles are improbable, particularly absent compelling bipartisan catalysts.\\n\\n(3) Timing constraints relative to 2026 midterms: Even if Democrats were to win the November 2026 House elections, the new majority would not be seated until January 2027 (the next Congress), which is outside the market’s resolution window. Therefore, a post-midterm partisan shift cannot produce an impeachment vote by December 31, 2026. Speculative reporting about preparing for possible impeachment if Democrats take the House in 2026 (Source 5) does not affect this market because any functional control change would occur in 2027.\\n\\n(4) Lack of momentum or credible signs of imminent passage: Beyond introduction and a notice of intent for privileged consideration, there is no evidence of Judiciary Committee advancement, floor scheduling, or coalition-building toward majority passage during the eligible window. Secondary summaries (Wikipedia overview of impeachment efforts, updated November 2025, Source 3) reflect no new House passage events. Other sources provided are either speculative/contextual (Sources 2, 8) or generic outlooks without concrete congressional movement (Grok search items), and thus do not demonstrate a pathway to passage within the timeframe.\\n\\n- Taken together: Current majority control, procedural gatekeeping, unchanged status of H.Res.353, and the post-2026 seating of any new House majority make passage by 12/31/2026 highly unlikely.\",\n  \"confidence\": 80,\n  \"confidenceReasoning\": \"(1) Strong primary-source grounding: Congress.gov and govinfo.gov provide authoritative, up-to-date legislative status for H.Res.353 (Sources 1 and 6), showing no House passage and only an intent notice for privileged consideration—clear, verifiable indicators against imminent adoption.\\n\\n(2) Institutional constraints align with historical practice: With a Republican-controlled House in the 119th Congress, leadership can and typically does control the floor to prevent unfavorable resolutions from passing. Newsweek’s reporting that GOP majorities make impeachment unlikely (Source 7) aligns with these procedural realities.\\n\\n(3) Residual uncertainty is non-zero: While unlikely, extraordinary events or major scandals could, in theory, shift enough votes or induce leadership to allow passage. However, there is no current evidence of such a shift. This limits confidence from being higher than ~80.\\n\\n(4) Data caveats: Some provided sources are speculative, tangential, or of mixed quality (e.g., Yahoo page truncation in Source 5; speculative/context-only Sources 2 and 8; generic Grok links without substantive new reporting).

Most of the search results are older or irrelevant, and many look generic. I need to be careful and consider multiple sources for accuracy, especially regarding the House control after the 2024 elections.**Assessing impeachment timeline**\n\nBased on research up to October 2024, it seems likely that Republicans will have a majority in early 2025. According to Newsweek, a Republican majority in both the House and Senate makes impeachment unlikely by February 2025. If they hold the House through into 2026, impeachment could only happen if Republicans and Democrats unite or if the Democrats gain control in the midterms. The timeline for impeachment would be from July 2025 to December 2026, and any Democratic control starting in January 2027 is too late for this window.**Analyzing impeachment chances**\n\nThe market period for impeachment is set between July 24, 2025, and December 31, 2026, with the understanding that midterm results in November 2026 won't change the majority until January 2027. Therefore, if the 119th Congress is Republican-controlled, the chances of impeachment are very low. It looks like Newsweek confirms a Republican majority in early 2025. Plus, a Democrat's resolution can be bottled up by the GOP majority, making it easy for them to table any impeachment efforts.**Evaluating impeachment developments**\n\nI need to see if any developments by November 2025 might change the situation regarding impeachment. Wikipedia's page on efforts to impeach suggests April 29, 2025, but it doesn’t indicate any successful passage, which would have made headlines. Currently, I don’t see any reports of impeachment votes or progress on H.Res.353, and that keeps the probability quite low, around 5-12%. The market shows an 8.5% chance of YES, which aligns well. Therefore, my prediction is a firm NO, with moderate-high confidence (about 75-85%). It's unlikely for a few GOP members to defect since many would need to for a majority shift.**Quantifying impeachment obstacles**\n\nTo analyze potential impeachment, I see several obstacles. First, the Republican control of the 119th House poses a significant barrier, where a simple majority is needed, and they can prevent actions like tabling the resolution. Time is limited until December 31, 2026. The introduced resolution, H.Res.353, hasn't progressed. Even if Democrats gain the House in 2026, they can't act until the 120th Congress begins in January 2027. Therefore, I predict a NO outcome with about a 9% chance of impeachment passing.

## Full Prediction Data

```json
{
  "marketId": "568116",
  "prediction": {
    "outcome": "NO",
    "outcomeReasoning": "(1) House action required within the window and current status: The market resolves YES only if the House passes one or more articles of impeachment between July 24, 2025 and December 31, 2026. The only formal vehicle identified in the record is H.Res.353, introduced April 28, 2025, which remains at \"Introduced\" status and was referred to the Judiciary Committee, with a May 13, 2025 notice of intent to offer as a privileged resolution but no adoption by the House to date. Primary sources: Congress.gov listing and actions for H.Res.353 (Source 1) and the authenticated text on govinfo.gov (Source 6).\n\n(2) Partisan control and procedural realities: Impeachment requires a simple majority vote in the House. Throughout the 119th Congress (2025–2026), Republicans hold the House majority, and the majority leadership can block, table, or refer a privileged impeachment resolution, preventing passage. Newsweek notes that a Republican majority in the House and Senate makes a third impeachment effort unlikely to succeed (Source 7). With GOP control, cross-party defections sufficient to pass articles are improbable, particularly absent compelling bipartisan catalysts.\n\n(3) Timing constraints relative to 2026 midterms: Even if Democrats were to win the November 2026 House elections, the new majority would not be seated until January 2027 (the next Congress), which is outside the market’s resolution window. Therefore, a post-midterm partisan shift cannot produce an impeachment vote by December 31, 2026. Speculative reporting about preparing for possible impeachment if Democrats take the House in 2026 (Source 5) does not affect this market because any functional control change would occur in 2027.\n\n(4) Lack of momentum or credible signs of imminent passage: Beyond introduction and a notice of intent for privileged consideration, there is no evidence of Judiciary Committee advancement, floor scheduling, or coalition-building toward majority passage during the eligible window. Secondary summaries (Wikipedia overview of impeachment efforts, updated November 2025, Source 3) reflect no new House passage events. Other sources provided are either speculative/contextual (Sources 2, 8) or generic outlooks without concrete congressional movement (Grok search items), and thus do not demonstrate a pathway to passage within the timeframe.\n\n- Taken together: Current majority control, procedural gatekeeping, unchanged status of H.Res.353, and the post-2026 seating of any new House majority make passage by 12/31/2026 highly unlikely.",
    "confidence": 80,
    "confidenceReasoning": "(1) Strong primary-source grounding: Congress.gov and govinfo.gov provide authoritative, up-to-date legislative status for H.Res.353 (Sources 1 and 6), showing no House passage and only an intent notice for privileged consideration—clear, verifiable indicators against imminent adoption.\n\n(2) Institutional constraints align with historical practice: With a Republican-controlled House in the 119th Congress, leadership can and typically does control the floor to prevent unfavorable resolutions from passing. Newsweek’s reporting that GOP majorities make impeachment unlikely (Source 7) aligns with these procedural realities.\n\n(3) Residual uncertainty is non-zero: While unlikely, extraordinary events or major scandals could, in theory, shift enough votes or induce leadership to allow passage. However, there is no current evidence of such a shift. This limits confidence from being higher than ~80.\n\n(4) Data caveats: Some provided sources are speculative, tangential, or of mixed quality (e.g., Yahoo page truncation in Source 5; speculative/context-only Sources 2 and 8; generic Grok links without substantive new reporting). Nonetheless, the decisive elements (bill status and House control dynamics) rest on high-quality or well-established information, supporting an overall high-moderate confidence.",
    "probability": 9,
    "keyFactors": [
      "GOP majority control of the House during the entire 119th Congress (2025–2026), limiting prospects for passage of impeachment articles (Source 7).",
      "H.Res.353 remains at Introduced status with no House adoption; only a notice of intent to offer as a privileged resolution was recorded (Sources 1, 6).",
      "Procedural ability of the House majority to table or refer privileged impeachment resolutions, preventing passage even if introduced (general House practice; reflected in Sources 1, 6 procedural notes).",
      "Timing: Any partisan shift from the 2026 midterms would not take effect until January 2027, outside the market window (structural calendar constraint).",
      "Lack of evidence for bipartisan momentum or committee/floor movement toward adoption during the eligibility period (Source 3 corroborates absence of passage).",
      "Historical rarity of bipartisan impeachments absent overwhelming consensus or crisis, especially under unified partisan control opposed to impeachment (context from Source 7)."

The first impeachment focused on allegations of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress related to his dealings with Ukraine, while the second impeachment was prompted by the January 6 Capitol riot, accusing him of incitement of insurrection. Both impeachments resulted in acquittals by the Senate. \n\nRegarding your query about whether Trump will be impeached by the end of 2026, the resolution of related markets hinges on whether the House of Representatives will pass articles of impeachment against him by a specified date.

Looking back, these are the things I wish I’d done sooner. 1. Your home equity is a gold mine - tap into it instead of getting a loan A lot of people turn to high-interest payday loans when they need cash (please don’t). If you own a home, you might have a much better option: a home equity line of credit ( HELOC). A HELOC lets you borrow against the equity in your house - kind of like a credit card, but with lower interest rates and more flexible repayment terms than most traditional loans. It’s often one of the cheapest ways to borrow money when you really need it. If you’re curious, here’s a calculator to see how much you might be able to get: link here. 2. Compare auto insurance companies every 6-12 months. If you haven’t compared auto insurance offers in the last 6 months, you’re probably overspending (on average by ~$460/year ¹). Example: I finally shopped around and ended up saving ~$1,300 this year by switching carriers for the exact same coverage. It took me about 5 minutes. Seriously, just check a comparison site (I used Coverage.com, but Auto-Savings.com works too). You’ll get multiple offers in one go, and worst case? You stay with what you’ve got. Best case? You save a few hundred bucks a year. Here’s a link to a decent comparison site: link. 3. Stop getting price gouged when you shop online.

Trump's advisers are reportedly taking the threat seriously, especially given that he is the only president to have been impeached twice. With significant changes already made to policies since his second term began, the urgency to push his agenda, including extending tax cuts set to expire at the end of 2025, has intensified. The administration is focused on passing crucial legislation before the midterms, as internal disagreements among Republicans pose challenges. The article highlights the high stakes involved, particularly in light of the looming possibility of impeachment proceedings if Democrats secure a majority.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Return to Homepage](https://www.yahoo.com)\n\n## Top Stories:\n\n- [Senate reaches shutdown deal](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/senators-near-deal-reopen-government-200820963.html)\n- [Flight cancellations](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/thanksgiving-air-traffic-could-slow-163901620.html)\n- [SNAP benefits paused](https://\n\n### Content\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Return to Homepage](https://www.yahoo.com)\n\n## Top Stories:\n\n- [Senate reaches shutdown deal](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/senators-near-deal-reopen-government-200820963.html)\n- [Flight cancellations](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/thanksgiving-air-traffic-could-slow-163901620.html)\n- [SNAP benefits paused](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-administration-tells-states-undo-155333628.html)\n- [Trump talks healthcare](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-urges-lawmakers-healthcare-money-145631423.html)\n- [Abrego Garcia update](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-admin-moves-dissolve-ban-152533849.html)\n- [More flights canceled](https://www.yahoo.com/news/us/live/flights-canceled-at-40-us-airports-full-coverage-as-faa-cuts-to-air-traffic-take-effect-amid-government-shutdown-162954349.html)\n- [NASA's journey to Mars](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/next-mars-launch-window-2026-122601304.html)\n- [A record Arctic blast?](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/early-arctic-cold-snap-could-184000871.html)\n- [Senate works the weekend](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/senators-weekend-shutdown-republicans-democrats-050149827.html)\n- [Full SNAP payments paused](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-admin-asks-supreme-court-235859390.html)\n\nTrump team is already preparing for an impeachment fight in case Dems take control of the House in 2026\n\nMore\n\nYahoo is using AI to generate takeaways from this article.

It highlights several factors that could lead to impeachment, including controversial policy decisions, allegations of financial misconduct, and foreign policy controversies. The piece emphasizes that if Trump were to make significant decisions perceived as unconstitutional or unethical, such as restricting reproductive healthcare or engaging in financial corruption, it could prompt calls for impeachment. The context is set against the backdrop of the political landscape in 2025, which may influence the likelihood of impeachment proceedings. \n\nIn relation to your query about whether Trump will be impeached by the end of 2026, the article suggests that while the possibility exists, it hinges on future actions and decisions made by Trump during his second term, as well as the political dynamics at play in Congress.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- In the aftermath of the tumultuous 2020 presidential election and the events that unfolded during the subsequent four years, the topic of impeaching former President Donald Trump continues to stir significant interest and debate.

This article delves into the implications and possibilities of such an event occurring once again in 2025, exploring the political landscape, legal intricacies, and potential outcomes. \n The Context of a Second Impeachment The year 2025 marks a significant juncture in American political history, as it coincides with the potential end of a second term for President Trump or the start of a new administration, should he be unseated. The idea of a second impeachment gains traction amidst the ongoing discussions and debates surrounding the legacy of the 45th President and the impact of his policies and actions on the nation. \n While the first impeachment trial, which occurred in early 2020, focused primarily on allegations of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, the prospect of a second impeachment would likely revolve around a different set of circumstances and charges. The specific events and actions leading up to such a scenario are impossible to predict with certainty, but several potential factors could contribute to a second impeachment effort. \n The Impact of Policy Decisions \n One key aspect that could trigger a renewed call for impeachment is the potential for controversial policy decisions made by President Trump during his second term.\n\n---\n\n# Grok Web Search Results\n\nThe following search results provide additional real-time context:\n\n## Result 1: Experts Weigh In: Could Trump Face Impeachment by 2026?\nURL: https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/15/politics/trump-impeachment-predictions-2026\nSource: CNN\nPublished: 2023-10-15T00:00:00Z\n\nPolitical analysts discuss the possibility of Donald Trump being impeached if he returns to office, citing ongoing legal battles and potential House dynamics.

The only formal vehicle identified in the record is H.Res.353, introduced April 28, 2025, which remains at \\\"Introduced\\\" status and was referred to the Judiciary Committee, with a May 13, 2025 notice of intent to offer as a privileged resolution but no adoption by the House to date. Primary sources: Congress.gov listing and actions for H.Res.353 (Source 1) and the authenticated text on govinfo.gov (Source 6).\\n\\n(2) Partisan control and procedural realities: Impeachment requires a simple majority vote in the House. Throughout the 119th Congress (2025–2026), Republicans hold the House majority, and the majority leadership can block, table, or refer a privileged impeachment resolution, preventing passage. Newsweek notes that a Republican majority in the House and Senate makes a third impeachment effort unlikely to succeed (Source 7). With GOP control, cross-party defections sufficient to pass articles are improbable, particularly absent compelling bipartisan catalysts.\\n\\n(3) Timing constraints relative to 2026 midterms: Even if Democrats were to win the November 2026 House elections, the new majority would not be seated until January 2027 (the next Congress), which is outside the market’s resolution window. Therefore, a post-midterm partisan shift cannot produce an impeachment vote by December 31, 2026. Speculative reporting about preparing for possible impeachment if Democrats take the House in 2026 (Source 5) does not affect this market because any functional control change would occur in 2027.\\n\\n(4) Lack of momentum or credible signs of imminent passage: Beyond introduction and a notice of intent for privileged consideration, there is no evidence of Judiciary Committee advancement, floor scheduling, or coalition-building toward majority passage during the eligible window. Secondary summaries (Wikipedia overview of impeachment efforts, updated November 2025, Source 3) reflect no new House passage events. Other sources provided are either speculative/contextual (Sources 2, 8) or generic outlooks without concrete congressional movement (Grok search items), and thus do not demonstrate a pathway to passage within the timeframe.\\n\\n- Taken together: Current majority control, procedural gatekeeping, unchanged status of H.Res.353, and the post-2026 seating of any new House majority make passage by 12/31/2026 highly unlikely.\",\n  \"confidence\": 80,\n  \"confidenceReasoning\": \"(1) Strong primary-source grounding: Congress.gov and govinfo.gov provide authoritative, up-to-date legislative status for H.Res.353 (Sources 1 and 6), showing no House passage and only an intent notice for privileged consideration—clear, verifiable indicators against imminent adoption.\\n\\n(2) Institutional constraints align with historical practice: With a Republican-controlled House in the 119th Congress, leadership can and typically does control the floor to prevent unfavorable resolutions from passing. Newsweek’s reporting that GOP majorities make impeachment unlikely (Source 7) aligns with these procedural realities.\\n\\n(3) Residual uncertainty is non-zero: While unlikely, extraordinary events or major scandals could, in theory, shift enough votes or induce leadership to allow passage. However, there is no current evidence of such a shift. This limits confidence from being higher than ~80.\\n\\n(4) Data caveats: Some provided sources are speculative, tangential, or of mixed quality (e.g., Yahoo page truncation in Source 5; speculative/context-only Sources 2 and 8; generic Grok links without substantive new reporting).

The truncated text and the random blogs from domains like \"realmedia.ucsf.edu\" and \"cs.uml.edu\" seem unofficial and don't inspire confidence. Most of the search results are older or irrelevant, and many look generic. I need to be careful and consider multiple sources for accuracy, especially regarding the House control after the 2024 elections.**Assessing impeachment timeline**\n\nBased on research up to October 2024, it seems likely that Republicans will have a majority in early 2025. According to Newsweek, a Republican majority in both the House and Senate makes impeachment unlikely by February 2025. If they hold the House through into 2026, impeachment could only happen if Republicans and Democrats unite or if the Democrats gain control in the midterms. The timeline for impeachment would be from July 2025 to December 2026, and any Democratic control starting in January 2027 is too late for this window.**Analyzing impeachment chances**\n\nThe market period for impeachment is set between July 24, 2025, and December 31, 2026, with the understanding that midterm results in November 2026 won't change the majority until January 2027. Therefore, if the 119th Congress is Republican-controlled, the chances of impeachment are very low. It looks like Newsweek confirms a Republican majority in early 2025. Plus, a Democrat's resolution can be bottled up by the GOP majority, making it easy for them to table any impeachment efforts.**Evaluating impeachment developments**\n\nI need to see if any developments by November 2025 might change the situation regarding impeachment. Wikipedia's page on efforts to impeach suggests April 29, 2025, but it doesn’t indicate any successful passage, which would have made headlines. Currently, I don’t see any reports of impeachment votes or progress on H.Res.353, and that keeps the probability quite low, around 5-12%. The market shows an 8.5% chance of YES, which aligns well. Therefore, my prediction is a firm NO, with moderate-high confidence (about 75-85%). It's unlikely for a few GOP members to defect since many would need to for a majority shift.**Quantifying impeachment obstacles**\n\nTo analyze potential impeachment, I see several obstacles. First, the Republican control of the 119th House poses a significant barrier, where a simple majority is needed, and they can prevent actions like tabling the resolution. Time is limited until December 31, 2026. The introduced resolution, H.Res.353, hasn't progressed. Even if Democrats gain the House in 2026, they can't act until the 120th Congress begins in January 2027. Therefore, I predict a NO outcome with about a 9% chance of impeachment passing.

The first impeachment focused on allegations of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress related to his dealings with Ukraine, while the second impeachment was prompted by the January 6 Capitol riot, accusing him of incitement of insurrection.

Looking back, these are the things I wish I’d done sooner. 1. Your home equity is a gold mine - tap into it instead of getting a loan A lot of people turn to high-interest payday loans when they need cash (please don’t). If you own a home, you might have a much better option: a home equity line of credit ( HELOC). A HELOC lets you borrow against the equity in your house - kind of like a credit card, but with lower interest rates and more flexible repayment terms than most traditional loans. It’s often one of the cheapest ways to borrow money when you really need it. If you’re curious, here’s a calculator to see how much you might be able to get: link here. 2. Compare auto insurance companies every 6-12 months. If you haven’t compared auto insurance offers in the last 6 months, you’re probably overspending (on average by ~$460/year ¹). Example: I finally shopped around and ended up saving ~$1,300 this year by switching carriers for the exact same coverage. It took me about 5 minutes. Seriously, just check a comparison site (I used Coverage.com, but Auto-Savings.com works too). You’ll get multiple offers in one go, and worst case? You stay with what you’ve got. Best case? You save a few hundred bucks a year. Here’s a link to a decent comparison site: link. 3. Stop getting price gouged when you shop online.

Trump's advisers are reportedly taking the threat seriously, especially given that he is the only president to have been impeached twice. With significant changes already made to policies since his second term began, the urgency to push his agenda, including extending tax cuts set to expire at the end of 2025, has intensified. The administration is focused on passing crucial legislation before the midterms, as internal disagreements among Republicans pose challenges. The article highlights the high stakes involved, particularly in light of the looming possibility of impeachment proceedings if Democrats secure a majority.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Return to Homepage](https://www.yahoo.com)\n\n## Top Stories:\n\n- [Senate reaches shutdown deal](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/senators-near-deal-reopen-government-200820963.html)\n- [Flight cancellations](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/thanksgiving-air-traffic-could-slow-163901620.html)\n- [SNAP benefits paused](https://\n\n### Content\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Return to Homepage](https://www.yahoo.com)\n\n## Top Stories:\n\n- [Senate reaches shutdown deal](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/senators-near-deal-reopen-government-200820963.html)\n- [Flight cancellations](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/thanksgiving-air-traffic-could-slow-163901620.html)\n- [SNAP benefits paused](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-administration-tells-states-undo-155333628.html)\n- [Trump talks healthcare](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-urges-lawmakers-healthcare-money-145631423.html)\n- [Abrego Garcia update](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-admin-moves-dissolve-ban-152533849.html)\n- [More flights canceled](https://www.yahoo.com/news/us/live/flights-canceled-at-40-us-airports-full-coverage-as-faa-cuts-to-air-traffic-take-effect-amid-government-shutdown-162954349.html)\n- [NASA's journey to Mars](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/next-mars-launch-window-2026-122601304.html)\n- [A record Arctic blast?](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/early-arctic-cold-snap-could-184000871.html)\n- [Senate works the weekend](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/senators-weekend-shutdown-republicans-democrats-050149827.html)\n- [Full SNAP payments paused](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-admin-asks-supreme-court-235859390.html)\n\nTrump team is already preparing for an impeachment fight in case Dems take control of the House in 2026\n\nMore\n\nYahoo is using AI to generate takeaways from this article.

It highlights several factors that could lead to impeachment, including controversial policy decisions, allegations of financial misconduct, and foreign policy controversies. The piece emphasizes that if Trump were to make significant decisions perceived as unconstitutional or unethical, such as restricting reproductive healthcare or engaging in financial corruption, it could prompt calls for impeachment. The context is set against the backdrop of the political landscape in 2025, which may influence the likelihood of impeachment proceedings. \n\nIn relation to your query about whether Trump will be impeached by the end of 2026, the article suggests that while the possibility exists, it hinges on future actions and decisions made by Trump during his second term, as well as the political dynamics at play in Congress.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- In the aftermath of the tumultuous 2020 presidential election and the events that unfolded during the subsequent four years, the topic of impeaching former President Donald Trump continues to stir significant interest and debate.

This article delves into the implications and possibilities of such an event occurring once again in 2025, exploring the political landscape, legal intricacies, and potential outcomes. \n The Context of a Second Impeachment The year 2025 marks a significant juncture in American political history, as it coincides with the potential end of a second term for President Trump or the start of a new administration, should he be unseated. The idea of a second impeachment gains traction amidst the ongoing discussions and debates surrounding the legacy of the 45th President and the impact of his policies and actions on the nation. \n While the first impeachment trial, which occurred in early 2020, focused primarily on allegations of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, the prospect of a second impeachment would likely revolve around a different set of circumstances and charges. The specific events and actions leading up to such a scenario are impossible to predict with certainty, but several potential factors could contribute to a second impeachment effort. \n The Impact of Policy Decisions \n One key aspect that could trigger a renewed call for impeachment is the potential for controversial policy decisions made by President Trump during his second term.\n\n---\n\n# Grok Web Search Results\n\nThe following search results provide additional real-time context:\n\n## Result 1: Experts Weigh In: Could Trump Face Impeachment by 2026?\nURL: https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/15/politics/trump-impeachment-predictions-2026\nSource: CNN\nPublished: 2023-10-15T00:00:00Z\n\nPolitical analysts discuss the possibility of Donald Trump being impeached if he returns to office, citing ongoing legal battles and potential House dynamics.

### Summary
The Wikipedia page on "Efforts to impeach Donald Trump" outlines the two formal impeachment proceedings against him: the first in 2019-2020 and the second in 2021. The first impeachment focused on allegations of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress related to his dealings with Ukraine, while the second impeachment was prompted by the January 6 Capitol riot, accusing him of incitement of insurrection. Both impeachments resulted in acquittals by the Senate. 

Regarding your query about whether Trump will be impeached by the end of 2026, the resolution of related markets hinges on whether the House of Representatives will pass articles of impeachment against him by a specified date. The page does not provide future predictions or outcomes but details the historical context and processes of impeachment. For the latest developments or potential future actions, you may need to consult current news sources or political analysis.

### Summary
The webpage does not provide relevant information regarding the likelihood of Donald Trump being impeached by the end of 2026, particularly in the context of the Democrats taking control of both chambers of Congress after the 2026 midterm elections. Instead, the content focuses on personal finance tips, such as utilizing home equity, comparing auto insurance, and saving money while shopping online. For insights on Trump's impeachment prospects, it would be advisable to consult political analysis sources or news articles that specifically address this topic.

When I bought my first home, I had no idea how many little expenses would pile up. Looking back, these are the things I wish I’d done sooner. 1. Your home equity is a gold mine - tap into it instead of getting a loan A lot of people turn to high-interest payday loans when they need cash (please don’t). If you own a home, you might have a much better option: a home equity line of credit ( HELOC). A HELOC lets you borrow against the equity in your house - kind of like a credit card, but with lower interest rates and more flexible repayment terms than most traditional loans. It’s often one of the cheapest ways to borrow money when you really need it. If you’re curious, here’s a calculator to see how much you might be able to get: link here. 2. Compare auto insurance companies every 6-12 months. If you haven’t compared auto insurance offers in the last 6 months, you’re probably overspending (on average by ~$460/year ¹). Example: I finally shopped around and ended up saving ~$1,300 this year by switching carriers for the exact same coverage. It took me about 5 minutes. Seriously, just check a comparison site (I used Coverage.com, but Auto-Savings.com works too). You’ll get multiple offers in one go, and worst case? You stay with what you’ve got. Best case? You save a few hundred bucks a year. Here’s a link to a decent comparison site: link. 3. Stop getting price gouged when you shop online. Big retailers (looking at you, Amazon) know that most people don’t have time to compare pri

Published: 2025-04-29T00:00:00.000Z

### Summary
The article discusses how Donald Trump's team is proactively preparing for a potential third impeachment if Democrats regain control of the House in the 2026 midterm elections. Trump's advisers are reportedly taking the threat seriously, especially given that he is the only president to have been impeached twice. With significant changes already made to policies since his second term began, the urgency to push his agenda, including extending tax cuts set to expire at the end of 2025, has intensified. The administration is focused on passing crucial legislation before the midterms, as internal disagreements among Republicans pose challenges. The article highlights the high stakes involved, particularly in light of the looming possibility of impeachment proceedings if Democrats secure a majority.

### Summary
The article discusses the possibility of a third impeachment for Donald Trump, initiated by Representative Al Green. Although the Republican majority in the House and Senate makes it unlikely for the impeachment effort to succeed, its introduction highlights ongoing political divisions.

The Constitution allows for multiple impeachments, raising questions about the grounds for such actions. The article does not provide a definitive answer regarding whether Trump will be impeached by the end of 2026, but it outlines the conditions under which it could occur.

 In the aftermath of the tumultuous 2020 presidential election and the events that unfolded during the subsequent four years, the topic of impeaching former President Donald Trump continues to stir significant interest and debate. This article delves into the implications and possibilities of such an event occurring once again in 2025, exploring the political landscape, legal intricacies, and potential outcomes. 
 The Context of a Second Impeachment The year 2025 marks a significant juncture in American political history, as it coincides with the potential end of a second term for President Trump or the start of a new administration, should he be unseated. The idea of a second impeachment gains traction amidst the ongoing discussions and debates surrounding the legacy of the 45th President and the impact of his policies and actions on the nation. 
 While the first impeachment trial, which occurred in early 2020, focused primarily on allegations of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, the prospect of a second impeachment would likely revolve around a different set of circumstances and charges. The specific events and actions leading up to such a scenario are impossible to predict with certainty, but several potential factors could contribute to a second impeachment effort. 
 The Impact of Policy Decisions 
 One key aspect that could trigger a renewed call for impeachment is the potential for controversial policy decisions made by President Trump during his second term.
