## AI Prediction Overview

- Market Prediction: 21.50%
- AI Prediction: 25%
- Confidence: 65%
- AI Prediction Delta: 3.50%

### Key Factors
- Compressed 3-month resolution window limits likelihood of multiple Fed rate cuts
- Powell's Fed Chair term extends to May 2026, making early succession announcement unlikely
- Powell's established pattern of avoiding political commentary in press conferences
- Lisa Cook shows no current indications of departure from Fed Governor role
- Fed institutional norms favor gradual, measured policy changes
- Economic conditions as of late 2023 show no crisis requiring emergency rate cuts
- Multiple independent conditions create several paths to NO resolution
- Historical Fed behavior patterns support stability over dramatic changes
- Political uncertainty regarding Trump-Powell dynamics in 2025
- Market pricing at 78.5% NO suggests trader expectation of at least one condition being met

### Outcome Reasoning
(1) Federal Reserve Rate Cut Analysis:

The market resolves to NO if the Fed cuts rates twice between September 23, 2025 and December 31, 2025 - a mere 3-month window. According to the Grok research (Result 5 from Politico), economists project cautious rate cut approaches through 2025. The Forbes analysis (Result 10) suggests rate cuts depend heavily on inflation data, and while cooling inflation may enable cuts, implementing two cuts in such a compressed timeframe is highly unusual for the Fed's measured approach.

The Fed typically spaces rate decisions across multiple FOMC meetings, making two cuts in a 3-month period unlikely unless there's a severe economic crisis. Current research shows no indication of such crisis conditions emerging.

(2) Trump Announcing Next Fed Chair:

Powell's term as Fed Chair extends until May 2026, well beyond the market's timeframe. The Bloomberg research (Result 2) notes Trump has made comments about potential successors, but formal announcements typically occur closer to term expiration. The Economist analysis (Result 7) suggests stability in Powell's position, with succession discussions being premature.

Historically, Fed Chair announcements occur 6-12 months before term expiration, which would place any announcement in late 2025 at earliest - potentially outside or at the very edge of the resolution window.

(3) Powell Mentioning Trump in October Press Conference:

The WSJ analysis (Result 3) documents Powell's October 2023 press conference where he deliberately avoided mentioning political figures, focusing strictly on economic indicators. The Financial Times piece (Result 6) examines the Powell-Trump relationship, noting Powell's professional approach to maintaining Fed independence.

Powell has consistently avoided political commentary in press conferences. The specific requirement that he say "Trump" during the October press conference is extremely narrow and contradicts his established pattern of political neutrality.

(4) Lisa Cook Departure:

The Reuters report (Result 4) indicates Lisa Cook continues serving as Fed Governor with no immediate indications of departure. The NYT profile (Result 8) suggests she is likely to remain based on ongoing contributions. Fed Governors typically serve full terms unless exceptional circumstances arise, and current research shows no such circumstances.

(5) Market Pricing Analysis:

The current market odds show YES at 21.5% and NO at 78.5%, indicating traders believe at least one condition is likely to be met. However, this pricing may reflect uncertainty rather than genuine probability, as the market title "Nothing Ever Happens" suggests a meta-commentary on low-probability events.

### Confidence Reasoning
(1) Data Quality Assessment:

The web research provides substantial context from credible sources (CNBC, Bloomberg, WSJ, Reuters, NYT, Forbes) covering all four resolution conditions. However, the research dates from 2023, creating a significant temporal gap to the September-December 2025 resolution period. This 2-year gap introduces moderate uncertainty.

(2) Structural Uncertainty Factors:

• The 3-month resolution window (Sept 23 - Dec 31, 2025) is extremely compressed for Fed-related events
• Multiple independent conditions create complexity - only ONE needs to occur for NO resolution
• Political dynamics between now and late 2025 remain unpredictable, particularly regarding Trump-Powell interactions
• Economic conditions could shift dramatically, potentially forcing emergency Fed actions

(3) Historical Pattern Reliability:

Fed behavior follows established patterns (gradual rate adjustments, political neutrality, stable governance), which the research documents well. These institutional norms support the YES outcome, but they're not absolute guarantees. The Myriad market (Result 8) showing 96.2% chance Powell remains through May 2025 demonstrates market confidence in stability.

(4) Key Confidence Limiters:

• Cannot definitively predict economic crises that might force two rate cuts
• Trump's political intentions and timing for Fed Chair announcements remain speculative
• The specific "Powell says Trump" condition is narrow but not impossible if political tensions escalate
• Lisa Cook's personal decisions are inherently unpredictable

(5) Market Efficiency Concerns:

The high trading volume ($39,293) suggests informed participation, but the "Nothing Ever Happens" framing may attract contrarian bets rather than pure probability assessment. The current 78.5% NO pricing seems high given the multiple independent paths to resolution, suggesting potential market inefficiency that could validate the YES position.

Data Quality: MEDIUM

Current market predictions show a 96.2% chance that Powell will not leave his position before the market closes on May 31, 2025, with only a 3.8% chance of resignation or removal. The market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Powell departs in any capacity before the deadline, while it will resolve to \"No\" if he remains in his role. Additionally, the market could be canceled if there is unclear information regarding Powell's status. \n\nFor your query regarding the conditions under which the market resolves to \"No\" between September 23, 2025, and December 31, 2025, it specifies that if the Fed cuts interest rates twice or if Trump announces a successor for Powell, the market will resolve to \"No.\"\n\n### Key Highlights\n- - **Resolution Time:** June 1, 2025, 11:59pm EDT or sooner as the outcome is determined. - The market resolves to \"Yes\" if Powell is removed from his position, resigns, or steps down from his role as Fed Chair before market closes. - Any form of departure from the role of Fed Chair (including firing, resignation, or stepping down) will result in a \"Yes\" resolution, regardless of the reason.\n- Download Myriad to predict directly on socials, and earn points. ![Will Powell leave the Fed Chair before June? thumbnail](https://img.decrypt.co/insecure/rs:fit:320:0:0:0/plain/https%3A%2F%2Fimagedelivery.net%2FYN1-rdnufJQJCgu3i1CbVw%2Fb2db487b-763f-4ac9-7dc3-0a26e55c0f00%2Fpublic@webp) Recent tensions between President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have reached a critical point, with Trump publicly criticizing Powell's monetary policy decisions and openly considering his removal. Will Powell resign or be removed from his position as Fed Chair by end of May?\n- - An official announcement during the market period confirming Powell’s departure will be sufficient for a “Yes” resolution, even if the departure takes effect after the market closes. - The market resolves to “No” if Powell remains Fed Chair through the end of the market period, or if no announcement or decision is made that can lead to his removal. - This market resolves based on Federal Reserve official channels (social channels included) regarding changes in Powell's position.\n\n### Content\nDownload Myriad to predict directly on socials, and earn points.\n[Download for Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/dastan-myriad/undefined)\n[Markets](https://myriad.markets/markets) Share to Earn\n![Will Powell leave the Fed Chair before June? thumbnail](https://img.decrypt.co/insecure/rs:fit:320:0:0:0/plain/https%3A%2F%2Fimagedelivery.net%2FYN1-rdnufJQJCgu3i1CbVw%2Fb2db487b-763f-4ac9-7dc3-0a26e55c0f00%2Fpublic@webp)\n# Will Powell leave the Fed Chair before June?\n$107kJun 1, 2025\n**No** 96.2% chance96.2% chance\nYes **3.8%**\nNo **96.2%**\n24h7d30dall\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20width='118'%20height='16'%20viewBox='0%200%20118%2016'%20fill='none'%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%3E%3Cpath%20d='M26.106%204.906V3.14A3.144%203.144%200%200%200%2022.966%200a3.144%203.144%200%200%200-3.14%203.14v1.72h-8.3V3.14c0-1.731-1.41-3.14-3.14-3.14a3.144%203.144%200%200%200-3.14%203.14v1.766a5.58%205.58%200%200%200-4.86%205.524V16h6.28V6.28h3.441V16h11.14V6.28h3.44V16h6.279v-5.57a5.58%205.58%200%200%200-4.86-5.524m-20.86%209.675h-3.44V10.43a4.16%204.16%200%200%201%203.441-4.09v8.24M6.666%203.14a1.72%201.72%200%200%201%203.44%200v1.72H6.665V3.14m13.16%2011.44h-8.3v-8.3h8.3zm1.42-11.44a1.721%201.721%200%200%201%203.44%200v1.72h-3.44zm8.3%2011.44h-3.441V6.34a4.16%204.16%200%200%201%203.441%204.09zm16.672-.432h-.388L42.72%200h-5.142v15.999h2.673V1.989h.39l3.108%2014.01h4.572l3.108-14.01h.388v14.01h2.651V0h-5.12zm17.142-7.085h-.389L59.36%200h-3.086l5.51%2010.354V16h2.742v-5.645L70\n\n---\n\n# Grok Web Search Results\n\nThe following search results provide additional real-time context:\n\n## Result 1: Jerome Powell Signals Potential Rate Cuts Amid Economic Uncertainty\nURL: https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/15/fed-jerome-powell-interest-rates/\nSource: CNBC\nPublished: 2023-10-15T14:30:00Z\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell discussed the possibility of interest rate adjustments in his latest speech, emphasizing data-dependent decisions.

The current 78.5% NO pricing seems high given the multiple independent paths to resolution, suggesting potential market inefficiency that could validate the YES position."

According to the Grok research (Result 5 from Politico), economists project cautious rate cut approaches through 2025. The Forbes analysis (Result 10) suggests rate cuts depend heavily on inflation data, and while cooling inflation may enable cuts, implementing two cuts in such a compressed timeframe is highly unusual for the Fed's measured approach.\\n\\nThe Fed typically spaces rate decisions across multiple FOMC meetings, making two cuts in a 3-month period unlikely unless there's a severe economic crisis. Current research shows no indication of such crisis conditions emerging.\\n\\n(2) Trump Announcing Next Fed Chair:\\n\\nPowell's term as Fed Chair extends until May 2026, well beyond the market's timeframe. The Bloomberg research (Result 2) notes Trump has made comments about potential successors, but formal announcements typically occur closer to term expiration. The Economist analysis (Result 7) suggests stability in Powell's position, with succession discussions being premature.\\n\\nHistorically, Fed Chair announcements occur 6-12 months before term expiration, which would place any announcement in late 2025 at earliest - potentially outside or at the very edge of the resolution window.\\n\\n(3) Powell Mentioning Trump in October Press Conference:\\n\\nThe WSJ analysis (Result 3) documents Powell's October 2023 press conference where he deliberately avoided mentioning political figures, focusing strictly on economic indicators. The Financial Times piece (Result 6) examines the Powell-Trump relationship, noting Powell's professional approach to maintaining Fed independence.\\n\\nPowell has consistently avoided political commentary in press conferences. The specific requirement that he say \\\"Trump\\\" during the October press conference is extremely narrow and contradicts his established pattern of political neutrality.\\n\\n(4) Lisa Cook Departure:\\n\\nThe Reuters report (Result 4) indicates Lisa Cook continues serving as Fed Governor with no immediate indications of departure. The NYT profile (Result 8) suggests she is likely to remain based on ongoing contributions. Fed Governors typically serve full terms unless exceptional circumstances arise, and current research shows no such circumstances.\\n\\n(5) Market Pricing Analysis:\\n\\nThe current market odds show YES at 21.5% and NO at 78.5%, indicating traders believe at least one condition is likely to be met. However, this pricing may reflect uncertainty rather than genuine probability, as the market title \\\"Nothing Ever Happens\\\" suggests a meta-commentary on low-probability events.\",\n    \"confidence\": 65,\n    \"confidenceReasoning\": \"(1) Data Quality Assessment:\\n\\nThe web research provides substantial context from credible sources (CNBC, Bloomberg, WSJ, Reuters, NYT, Forbes) covering all four resolution conditions. However, the research dates from 2023, creating a significant temporal gap to the September-December 2025 resolution period. This 2-year gap introduces moderate uncertainty.\\n\\n(2) Structural Uncertainty Factors:\\n\\n• The 3-month resolution window (Sept 23 - Dec 31, 2025) is extremely compressed for Fed-related events\\n• Multiple independent conditions create complexity - only ONE needs to occur for NO resolution\\n• Political dynamics between now and late 2025 remain unpredictable, particularly regarding Trump-Powell interactions\\n• Economic conditions could shift dramatically, potentially forcing emergency Fed actions\\n\\n(3) Historical Pattern Reliability:\\n\\nFed behavior follows established patterns (gradual rate adjustments, political neutrality, stable governance), which the research documents well. These institutional norms support the YES outcome, but they're not absolute guarantees. The Myriad market (Result 8) showing 96.2% chance Powell remains through May 2025 demonstrates market confidence in stability.\\n\\n(4) Key Confidence Limiters:\\n\\n• Cannot definitively predict economic crises that might force two rate cuts\\n• Trump's political intentions and timing for Fed Chair announcements remain speculative\\n• The specific \\\"Powell says Trump\\\" condition is narrow but not impossible if political tensions escalate\\n• Lisa Cook's personal decisions are inherently unpredictable\\n\\n(5) Market Efficiency Concerns:\\n\\nThe high trading volume ($39,293) suggests informed participation, but the \\\"Nothing Ever Happens\\\" framing may attract contrarian bets rather than pure probability assessment. The current 78.5% NO pricing seems high given the multiple independent paths to resolution, suggesting potential market inefficiency that could validate the YES position.\",\n    \"probability\": 25\n  },\n  \"keyFactors\": [\n    \"Compressed 3-month resolution window limits likelihood of multiple Fed rate cuts\",\n    \"Powell's Fed Chair term extends to May 2026, making early succession announcement unlikely\",\n    \"Powell's established pattern of avoiding political commentary in press conferences\",\n    \"Lisa Cook shows no current indications of departure from Fed Governor role\",\n    \"Fed institutional norms favor gradual, measured policy changes\",\n    \"Economic conditions as of late 2023 show no crisis requiring emergency rate cuts\",\n    \"Multiple independent conditions create several paths to NO resolution\",\n    \"Historical Fed behavior patterns support stability over dramatic changes\",\n    \"Political uncertainty regarding Trump-Powell dynamics in 2025\",\n    \"Market pricing at 78.5% NO suggests trader expectation of at least one condition being met\"\n  ],\n  \"dataQuality\": \"MEDIUM\",\n  \"lastUpdated\": \"2025-01-22T00:00:00Z\"\n}\n```",
