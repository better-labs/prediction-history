## AI Prediction Overview

- Market Prediction: 6.60%
- AI Prediction: 7%
- Confidence: 72%
- AI Prediction Delta: 0.40%

### Key Factors
- Stringent resolution criteria requiring permanent removal, not temporary incapacity [Source 4; market description]
- Historical rarity of resignation/removal and no sustained 25th Section 4 precedent [Result 8, NPR]
- High institutional thresholds (2/3 Senate for removal; 2/3 of both houses to sustain 25th Section 4) [Source 4]
- Convergent low odds across prediction markets (Polymarket ~6.6% YES; Manifold resignation ~7%; removal markets low) [Market details; Source 1; Source 10]
- Short time window to March 31, 2026 reduces cumulative risk vs. full‑term probabilities
- Speculative but non‑actionable signals on legal/health risks lacking credible near‑term triggers [Results 5, 9; Source 8]

### Outcome Reasoning
(1) Resolution criteria and what qualifies by the deadline. The market resolves YES only if Donald Trump resigns, is permanently removed (e.g., impeachment and conviction, or a sustained Twenty-Fifth Amendment Section 4), or otherwise ceases to be President for any period by March 31, 2026. Temporary incapacity does not count. A sustained Section 4 requires VP/Cabinet action upheld by two-thirds of both houses, which is an extremely high bar [Source 4; market description in prompt].

(2) Historical baseline strongly favors NO. Only one U.S. president has ever resigned (Nixon), no president has ever been removed by Senate conviction, and a sustained 25th Amendment Section 4 has never occurred. Expert coverage notes removal scenarios are rare and historically unprecedented in key respects [Result 8, NPR, discusses impeachment/removal scenarios and historical context].

(3) Institutional hurdles make near-term removal highly unlikely. Impeachment is relatively more common, but removal requires a two‑thirds Senate vote; Section 4 requires two‑thirds of both houses to sustain. Absent a catastrophic event, these thresholds are prohibitive in the current polarized environment [Source 4 for 25th mechanisms; Result 8, NPR, on impeachment dynamics].

(4) Forecasting and market signals are clustered around a low single‑digit to high single‑digit probability for early exit. A Manifold market on Trump resigning at any time in his second term is around 7% [Source 1]. Related Manifold markets show higher probabilities for House impeachment but much lower for removal, with a separate market on impeachment-and-removal during the term at roughly 7% (indicative for the entire term, not just by Mar 2026) [Source 10]. The Polymarket price here is ~6.6% YES, consistent with a low likelihood in this shorter window (through Mar 31, 2026).

(5) Time horizon further reduces the chance relative to full-term risk. The window to Mar 31, 2026 is the first ~14 months of the term. Even if long‑run risks (legal, political, health) exist, concentrating them into this early period lowers the cumulative probability. While some betting commentary notes rising speculation amid economic/legal uncertainties [Source 8; Results 5 and 7], there is no credible reporting of an imminent resignation or institutional move toward permanent removal.

(6) Legal and health uncertainties are acknowledged but lack concrete triggers for permanent removal by the deadline. Analyses outline potential legal pathways and health‑based 25th scenarios, but these remain speculative without specific, credible, near‑term developments [Result 5, Washington Post; Result 9, Guardian]. The Penn Law Review piece clarifies the mechanisms but does not indicate likelihood [Source 4].

Given the stringent criteria, short time frame, historical rarity, and convergent market odds, NO is the most probable outcome.

### Confidence Reasoning
(1) Convergent market indicators. Independent forecasting markets cluster around ~6–7% for resignation and similarly low single digits for removal across the entire term, with Polymarket showing ~6.6% YES for this earlier deadline [Market details in prompt; Source 1; Source 10]. This cross‑market alignment supports a NO prediction.

(2) Strong structural priors. The constitutional and institutional thresholds for permanent removal are exceptionally high, and historical precedent is scarce to nonexistent for the relevant mechanisms [Source 4; Result 8, NPR]. These priors meaningfully bolster confidence in NO within the short window.

(3) Data limitations temper certainty. Much of the research consists of secondary commentary, older context pieces (2023), and betting/gambling coverage without granular, up‑to‑date primary reporting on any imminent removal/resignation [Results 5, 7, 9; Source 8]. The Kalshi pages lack current pricing details ("Loading...") [Sources 2, 9].

(4) Tail‑risk acknowledgment. Sudden health events, major scandals, or rapid political realignments could alter outcomes quickly; the market also resolves YES upon announcement even if effective later. These low‑probability, high‑impact events keep confidence below very high levels.

On balance, structural and market evidence justify moderate‑high confidence in NO, but data recency/quality constraints and tail risks prevent higher than ~72%.

Data Quality: 62

## Market Overview

- Question: Trump out as President by March 31?
- Market: [View on Polymarket](https://polymarket.com/event/73968/trump-out-as-president-by-march-31)
- Market ID: 666860
- Description: This market will resolve to “Yes” if Donald Trump resigns or is removed as President or otherwise ceases to be the President of the United States for any period of time by March 31, 2026, 11:59 PM ET. Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No”.

An announcement of Donald Trump's resignation/removal before this market's end date will immediately resolve this market to "Yes", regardless of when the announced resignation/removal goes into effect.

Only permanent removal from office will qualify. Temporary removal (e.g. temporary invocation of the 25th Amendment under Section 3 or a Section 4 invocation not sustained by both Houses of Congress) or impeachment without removal will not count.

A sustained invocation of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment, Section 4 (i.e., if both Houses of Congress, by two-thirds vote, uphold the Vice President and Cabinet’s determination of presidential inability) will qualify for a "Yes" resolution. 

The resolution source for this market will be a consensus of credible reporting.
- End Date: 2026-03-31T00:00:00Z

It argues that the Constitution mandates the president to personally oversee the executive branch, and severe impairments can breach this duty. The piece outlines that if a president is unable to fulfill these responsibilities, they must either resign or transfer power to the Vice President under Section Three of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment. If the president refuses, the Vice President and Cabinet can invoke Section Four to remove the president, and if they do not act, Congress must impeach the president.\n\nIn the context of your query regarding Donald Trump's potential removal from office by March 31, 2026, this article suggests that if he were to develop severe impairments that hinder his ability to perform presidential duties, there are constitutional mechanisms in place for his removal. This could occur through resignation, voluntary power transfer, or actions taken by the Vice President and Cabinet, or ultimately through impeachment by Congress.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- [Skip to main content](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol173/iss2/5/#main)\n\n- [Home](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu)\n- [About](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/about.html)\n- [FAQ](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/faq.html)\n- [My Account](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/myaccount.cgi?context=)\n\n[Home](https://scholarship.law.upen\n\n### Content\n[Skip to main content](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol173/iss2/5/#main)\n\n- [Home](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu)\n- [About](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/about.html)\n- [FAQ](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/faq.html)\n- [My Account](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/myaccount.cgi?context=)\n\n[Home](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu)\n\\> [Penn Carey Law Journals](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/pennlawjnls)\n\\> [PENN\\_LAW\\_REVIEW](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review)\n\\> [Vol. 173 (2024-2025)](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol173)\n\\> [Iss. 2 (2025)](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol173/iss2)\n\n# [Presidential Disability and Mandatory Removal](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=9878&context=penn_law_review)\n\n## Authors\n\n[**Ari Goldstein**, _University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School L'25_](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/do/search/?q=author%3A%22Ari%20Goldstein%22&start=0&context=3571832)\n\n## Publication Date\n\nWinter 2025\n\n## First Page\n\n593\n\n## Document Type\n\nComment\n\n## Abstract\n\nPresidents often develop physical and mental impairments during their tenure in the White House.

Trump being convicted of at least one count in his federal court cases before the end of 2024. It invites users to make predictions and engage with the question, which is currently under review by moderators. The platform encourages community feedback and collaboration among users to refine the question. \n\nIn relation to your query about whether Trump will be out as President by March 31, 2026, the resolution of that market hinges on whether he resigns, is removed, or otherwise ceases to be President by that date. The two questions are interconnected, as a conviction could potentially influence his status as President, but the webpage specifically focuses on the legal outcomes of his federal cases rather than his presidential status.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Question\n\nApproval\nNotify Me\nShare private question\nUnsubscribe from question\nInvite Coauthors\nRemove myself\n[Download CSV](https://www.metaculus.com/api2/questions/18233/download_csv/)\n\n#### Your submission is now a Draft.\n\nOnce it's ready, please submit your draft for review by our team of Community Moderators.

The market resolves YES only if Donald Trump resigns, is permanently removed (e.g., impeachment and conviction, or a sustained Twenty-Fifth Amendment Section 4), or otherwise ceases to be President for any period by March 31, 2026. Temporary incapacity does not count. A sustained Section 4 requires VP/Cabinet action upheld by two-thirds of both houses, which is an extremely high bar [Source 4; market description in prompt].\\n\\n(2) Historical baseline strongly favors NO. Only one U.S. president has ever resigned (Nixon), no president has ever been removed by Senate conviction, and a sustained 25th Amendment Section 4 has never occurred. Expert coverage notes removal scenarios are rare and historically unprecedented in key respects [Result 8, NPR, discusses impeachment/removal scenarios and historical context].\\n\\n(3) Institutional hurdles make near-term removal highly unlikely. Impeachment is relatively more common, but removal requires a two‑thirds Senate vote; Section 4 requires two‑thirds of both houses to sustain. Absent a catastrophic event, these thresholds are prohibitive in the current polarized environment [Source 4 for 25th mechanisms; Result 8, NPR, on impeachment dynamics].\\n\\n(4) Forecasting and market signals are clustered around a low single‑digit to high single‑digit probability for early exit. A Manifold market on Trump resigning at any time in his second term is around 7% [Source 1]. Related Manifold markets show higher probabilities for House impeachment but much lower for removal, with a separate market on impeachment-and-removal during the term at roughly 7% (indicative for the entire term, not just by Mar 2026) [Source 10]. The Polymarket price here is ~6.6% YES, consistent with a low likelihood in this shorter window (through Mar 31, 2026).\\n\\n(5) Time horizon further reduces the chance relative to full-term risk. The window to Mar 31, 2026 is the first ~14 months of the term. Even if long‑run risks (legal, political, health) exist, concentrating them into this early period lowers the cumulative probability. While some betting commentary notes rising speculation amid economic/legal uncertainties [Source 8; Results 5 and 7], there is no credible reporting of an imminent resignation or institutional move toward permanent removal.\\n\\n(6) Legal and health uncertainties are acknowledged but lack concrete triggers for permanent removal by the deadline. Analyses outline potential legal pathways and health‑based 25th scenarios, but these remain speculative without specific, credible, near‑term developments [Result 5, Washington Post; Result 9, Guardian]. The Penn Law Review piece clarifies the mechanisms but does not indicate likelihood [Source 4].\\n\\nGiven the stringent criteria, short time frame, historical rarity, and convergent market odds, NO is the most probable outcome.\",\n  \"confidence\": 72,\n  \"confidenceReasoning\": \"(1) Convergent market indicators. Independent forecasting markets cluster around ~6–7% for resignation and similarly low single digits for removal across the entire term, with Polymarket showing ~6.6% YES for this earlier deadline [Market details in prompt; Source 1; Source 10]. This cross‑market alignment supports a NO prediction.\\n\\n(2) Strong structural priors. The constitutional and institutional thresholds for permanent removal are exceptionally high, and historical precedent is scarce to nonexistent for the relevant mechanisms [Source 4; Result 8, NPR]. These priors meaningfully bolster confidence in NO within the short window.\\n\\n(3) Data limitations temper certainty. Much of the research consists of secondary commentary, older context pieces (2023), and betting/gambling coverage without granular, up‑to‑date primary reporting on any imminent removal/resignation [Results 5, 7, 9; Source 8]. The Kalshi pages lack current pricing details (\\\"Loading...\\\") [Sources 2, 9].\\n\\n(4) Tail‑risk acknowledgment. Sudden health events, major scandals, or rapid political realignments could alter outcomes quickly; the market also resolves YES upon announcement even if effective later. These low‑probability, high‑impact events keep confidence below very high levels.\\n\\nOn balance, structural and market evidence justify moderate‑high confidence in NO, but data recency/quality constraints and tail risks prevent higher than ~72%.\",\n  \"probability\": 7,\n  \"keyFactors\": [\n    \"Stringent resolution criteria requiring permanent removal, not temporary incapacity [Source 4; market description]\",\n    \"Historical rarity of resignation/removal and no sustained 25th Section 4 precedent [Result 8, NPR]\",\n    \"High institutional thresholds (2/3 Senate for removal; 2/3 of both houses to sustain 25th Section 4) [Source 4]\",\n    \"Convergent low odds across prediction markets (Polymarket ~6.6% YES; Manifold resignation ~7%; removal markets low) [Market details; Source 1; Source 10]\",\n    \"Short time window to March 31, 2026 reduces cumulative risk vs. full‑term probabilities\",\n    \"Speculative but non‑actionable signals on legal/health risks lacking credible near‑term triggers [Results 5, 9; Source 8]\"\n  ],\n  \"dataQuality\": 62,\n  \"lastUpdated\": \"2025-11-13T00:00:00Z\"\n}",

The sources provide various insights: one law review piece discusses constitutional mechanisms without making predictions, while another suggests a 55% chance of impeachment by the House, but removal is much less likely. Some gambling sites are showing \"increasing odds\" due to economic factors, but they may not be the most reliable sources.**Evaluating quality and probabilities**\n\nI'm assessing quality for predictions in 2025, and it's looking low. One source gives a removal possibility by January 31, 2026, but the price isn’t clear. Another source from Metaculus about conviction before 2024 doesn’t seem relevant. I’m checking Kalshi markets, which show interest but lack details; the market price for a YES is at 6.6%. Given the timeframe until March 31, 2026, I’m thinking about setting the probability at 6-10%. For a 79-year-old male, the hazard risk of death may be around 2-3% in 14 months, which would count under removal categories.**Assessing removal risks**\n\nI'm considering the additional risks posed by legal issues. Impeachment requires a two-thirds Senate vote, which seems highly unlikely without a major scandal. The likelihood for a sustained 25th Amendment removal is even lower, needing two-thirds from both houses. Considering Trump's personality, resignation also appears low. Historically, there was only one case—Nixon, and that happened amid a serious threat of removal. For estimating the risk of death or incapacitation by March 31, 2026, it might be around 2-4%, with a more specific 2% risk in 14 months due to age factors.**Clarifying resignation and removal probabilities**\n\nI think we should really avoid using any unsourced numbers. For resignation, Manifold indicates a 7% probability for the entire term, with it being lower, around 2-3%, in the early timeframe leading to March 2026, so it’s still quite low. As for removal by impeachment, it seems extremely unlikely by that same date, largely depending on party control, which we don't have information about for 2025. Getting two-thirds Senate approval is tough, especially if Republicans maintain even a substantial minority. For invoking the 25th Amendment, that also seems improbable, probably keeping the overall probability under 10%. Setting it around 7% seems reasonable, given my confidence level of about 72%.**Assessing data quality and probabilities**\n\nI’m analyzing data quality and it seems mixed. Some credible sources, like the Penn Law Review, provide insight, but predictions from Manifold and Gambling.com are moderate. I’d rate the overall quality at around 60-65, so I'll choose 62. \n\nFor probabilities, Manifold shows a 7% chance for resignation, and 6.6% on Polymarket for a YES outcome. Impeachment odds are 55% per Manifold, but removal is less likely. Considering historical context, resignation and removal have rarely occurred, which I can support by citing NPR. Another important factor is timing—by March 31, 2026, the risk reduces, and I believe a 7% prediction aligns well with market signals. Ultimately, my confidence is at about 72%.**Crafting outcome reasoning**\n\nI need to work on the outcome reasoning, starting with resolution criteria. It's essential to outline what counts and the timeframe, referencing Polymarket’s description and Source 4. \n\nNext, I’ll highlight the historical rarity of such events, using NPR as a reference. Institutional hurdles for removal, like the 25th Amendment requiring two-thirds support, are important points to mention as well, linking back to NPR and law reviews for context.\n\nMarket signals show Polymarket pricing at 6.6% for a YES, and Manifold indicates 7% for resignation and removal, which suggests a low consensus probability; I'll cite Sources 1 and 10.\n\nConsidering the 14-month horizon until March 2026 also helps reduce risk compared to a full term. While there are speculative trends noted, the evidence isn’t strong.\n\nLegal and health concerns are present but lack sufficient evidence for invoking the 25th or removal by then—sources like WaPo and The Guardian will support this.\n\nMy confidence reasoning indicates alignment near 6-7% across markets, enhancing the signal. The historic rarity and institutional hurdles bolster my confidence.\n\nHowever, I acknowledge data gaps, including the absence of current primary signals and reliance on older commentary, which could affect my confidence level. The risk of sudden health issues or scandals introduces additional uncertainty.\n\nI’ll set the data quality rating at 62 and note all relevant sources. Let's prepare the JSON accordingly, making sure the paragraphs are properly formatted and that the bullet points are included as needed.",

It argues that the Constitution mandates the president to personally oversee the executive branch, and severe impairments can breach this duty. The piece outlines that if a president is unable to fulfill these responsibilities, they must either resign or transfer power to the Vice President under Section Three of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment. If the president refuses, the Vice President and Cabinet can invoke Section Four to remove the president, and if they do not act, Congress must impeach the president.\n\nIn the context of your query regarding Donald Trump's potential removal from office by March 31, 2026, this article suggests that if he were to develop severe impairments that hinder his ability to perform presidential duties, there are constitutional mechanisms in place for his removal. This could occur through resignation, voluntary power transfer, or actions taken by the Vice President and Cabinet, or ultimately through impeachment by Congress.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- [Skip to main content](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol173/iss2/5/#main)\n\n- [Home](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu)\n- [About](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/about.html)\n- [FAQ](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/faq.html)\n- [My Account](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/myaccount.cgi?context=)\n\n[Home](https://scholarship.law.upen\n\n### Content\n[Skip to main content](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol173/iss2/5/#main)\n\n- [Home](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu)\n- [About](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/about.html)\n- [FAQ](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/faq.html)\n- [My Account](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/myaccount.cgi?context=)\n\n[Home](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu)\n\\> [Penn Carey Law Journals](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/pennlawjnls)\n\\> [PENN\\_LAW\\_REVIEW](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review)\n\\> [Vol. 173 (2024-2025)](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol173)\n\\> [Iss. 2 (2025)](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol173/iss2)\n\n# [Presidential Disability and Mandatory Removal](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=9878&context=penn_law_review)\n\n## Authors\n\n[**Ari Goldstein**, _University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School L'25_](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/do/search/?q=author%3A%22Ari%20Goldstein%22&start=0&context=3571832)\n\n## Publication Date\n\nWinter 2025\n\n## First Page\n\n593\n\n## Document Type\n\nComment\n\n## Abstract\n\nPresidents often develop physical and mental impairments during their tenure in the White House.

## Source 4: Presidential Disability and Mandatory Removal
URL: https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol173/iss2/5/
Published: 2025-02-13T00:00:00.000Z
Author: Ari Goldstein

### Summary
The article "Presidential Disability and Mandatory Removal" by Ari Goldstein discusses the constitutional implications of a president's physical or mental impairments during their term. It argues that the Constitution mandates the president to personally oversee the executive branch, and severe impairments can breach this duty. The piece outlines that if a president is unable to fulfill these responsibilities, they must either resign or transfer power to the Vice President under Section Three of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment. If the president refuses, the Vice President and Cabinet can invoke Section Four to remove the president, and if they do not act, Congress must impeach the president.

In the context of your query regarding Donald Trump's potential removal from office by March 31, 2026, this article suggests that if he were to develop severe impairments that hinder his ability to perform presidential duties, there are constitutional mechanisms in place for his removal. This could occur through resignation, voluntary power transfer, or actions taken by the Vice President and Cabinet, or ultimately through impeachment by Congress.

## Abstract

Presidents often develop physical and mental impairments during their tenure in the White House. While certain impairments have a neutral or even positive effect on a president’s leadership capacity, others severely diminish it. Does such diminished leadership violate the Constitution? This Comment answers that question by advancing three novel claims. First, the Constitution imposes on t

Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No”.\n\nAn announcement of Donald Trump's resignation/removal before this market's end date will immediately resolve this market to \"Yes\", regardless of when the announced resignation/removal goes into effect.\n\nOnly permanent removal from office will qualify. Temporary removal (e.g. temporary invocation of the 25th Amendment under Section 3 or a Section 4 invocation not sustained by both Houses of Congress) or impeachment without removal will not count.\n\nA sustained invocation of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment, Section 4 (i.e., if both Houses of Congress, by two-thirds vote, uphold the Vice President and Cabinet’s determination of presidential inability) will qualify for a \"Yes\" resolution. \n\nThe resolution source for this market will be a consensus of credible reporting.\n\n## Market Details\n- Market ID: 666860\n- Condition ID: 0xfc9ee9c25abd5b966088767214c22dcf3ad1c72548e9a1dbef9d4328c170e5b5\n- Active: Yes\n- Closed: No\n- Current Volume: 21986.262442\n- Current Liquidity: 23862.09753\n- Current Outcome Prices: YES: 6.6%, NO: 93.4%\n\n---\n\n# Web Research Data\n\nThe following information was gathered from web research to provide context for this prediction:\n\n## Source 1: Will Trump resign prior to the end of his term?\nURL: https://manifold.markets/TotalVerb/will-trump-resign-prior-to-the-end\nPublished: 2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\n\n### Summary\nThe webpage discusses a betting market on whether Donald Trump will resign before the end of his second term.

It argues that the Constitution mandates the president to personally oversee the executive branch, and severe impairments can breach this duty. The piece outlines that if a president is unable to fulfill these responsibilities, they must either resign or transfer power to the Vice President under Section Three of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment. If the president refuses, the Vice President and Cabinet can invoke Section Four to remove the president, and if they do not act, Congress must impeach the president.\n\nIn the context of your query regarding Donald Trump's potential removal from office by March 31, 2026, this article suggests that if he were to develop severe impairments that hinder his ability to perform presidential duties, there are constitutional mechanisms in place for his removal. This could occur through resignation, voluntary power transfer, or actions taken by the Vice President and Cabinet, or ultimately through impeachment by Congress.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- [Skip to main content](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol173/iss2/5/#main)\n\n- [Home](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu)\n- [About](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/about.html)\n- [FAQ](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/faq.html)\n- [My Account](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/myaccount.cgi?context=)\n\n[Home](https://scholarship.law.upen\n\n### Content\n[Skip to main content](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol173/iss2/5/#main)\n\n- [Home](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu)\n- [About](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/about.html)\n- [FAQ](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/faq.html)\n- [My Account](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/myaccount.cgi?context=)\n\n[Home](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu)\n\\> [Penn Carey Law Journals](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/pennlawjnls)\n\\> [PENN\\_LAW\\_REVIEW](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review)\n\\> [Vol. 173 (2024-2025)](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol173)\n\\> [Iss. 2 (2025)](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol173/iss2)\n\n# [Presidential Disability and Mandatory Removal](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=9878&context=penn_law_review)\n\n## Authors\n\n[**Ari Goldstein**, _University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School L'25_](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/do/search/?q=author%3A%22Ari%20Goldstein%22&start=0&context=3571832)\n\n## Publication Date\n\nWinter 2025\n\n## First Page\n\n593\n\n## Document Type\n\nComment\n\n## Abstract\n\nPresidents often develop physical and mental impairments during their tenure in the White House.

Currently, there is a 55% chance predicted for his impeachment by the House, similar to his previous two impeachments. The question focuses solely on impeachment by the House, with Senate conviction not affecting the outcome. The market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Trump is officially impeached, and it will resolve as N/A if he does not win the presidency again. \n\nFor your specific query regarding whether Trump will be out as President by March 31, 2026, the market resolution will be \"Yes\" if he resigns, is removed, or otherwise ceases to be President by that date. The current discussions and predictions do not directly address this timeline but indicate ongoing speculation about his political future.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Open options\n\nWill Donald Trump be impeached during his second term?\n\n[Matt P](https://manifold.markets/MattP)\n\n254\n10kṀ65k\n\n2029\n\n55%\n\nchance\n\n1H\n\n6H\n\n1D\n\n1W\n\n1M\n\nALL\n\nBet YESBet NO\n\nQuestion resolves based on him being officially impeached by the House (as he was twice during his first term); conviction by the Senate does not affect this question one way o\n\n### Content\nOpen options\n\nWill Donald Trump be impeached during his second term?\n\n[Matt P](https://manifold.markets/MattP)\n\n254\n10kṀ65k\n\n2029\n\n55%\n\nchance\n\n1H\n\n6H\n\n1D\n\n1W\n\n1M\n\nALL\n\nBet YESBet NO\n\nQuestion resolves based on him being officially impeached by the House (as he was twice during his first term); conviction by the Senate does not affect this question one way or the other.\n\nResolves N/A in the (now quite unlikely) event that he does not win.\n\nThis question is managed and resolved by Manifold.\n\n[Trump](https://manifold.markets/news/what-will-trump-do)\n\n[US Politics](https://manifold.markets/topic/us-politics)\n\n[Politics](https://manifold.markets/topic/politics-default)\n\n[Trump](https://manifold.markets/topic/donald-trump)\n\n[Republican Party](https://manifold.markets/topic/magaland)\n\n[2024 US Presidential Election](https://manifold.markets/topic/2024-us-presidential-election)\n\n[US Democracy](https://manifold.markets/topic/us-democracy)\n\nFollow\n\nSign upGet\n1,000\nto start trading!\n\n## People are also trading\n\n[Will Trump invoke the Insurrection Act during his second term?\\\n\\\nFranklin Baldo\\\n\\\n56% chance](https://manifold.markets/FranklinBaldo/will-trump-invoke-the-insurrection) [Will Donald Trump be impeached and removed during his second term?\\\n\\\ncshunter\\\n\\\n7% chance](https://manifold.markets/cash/will-donald-trump-be-impeached-and) [Will Trump be impeached for a third (total) time during his second term?\\\n\\\nAryeh Zax\\\n\\\n47% chance](https://manifold.markets/zax/will-trump-be-impea\n\n---\n\n# Grok Web Search Results\n\nThe following search results provide additional real-time context:\n\n## Result 1: Trump's 2024 Bid Faces New Challenges Amid Legal Battles\nURL: https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/15/politics/trump-2024-campaign-update/index.html\nSource: CNN\nPublished: 2023-09-15T14:30:00Z\n\nRecent developments in Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign highlight ongoing legal indictments that could impact his eligibility.

The market resolves YES only if Donald Trump resigns, is permanently removed (e.g., impeachment and conviction, or a sustained Twenty-Fifth Amendment Section 4), or otherwise ceases to be President for any period by March 31, 2026. Temporary incapacity does not count. A sustained Section 4 requires VP/Cabinet action upheld by two-thirds of both houses, which is an extremely high bar [Source 4; market description in prompt].\\n\\n(2) Historical baseline strongly favors NO. Only one U.S. president has ever resigned (Nixon), no president has ever been removed by Senate conviction, and a sustained 25th Amendment Section 4 has never occurred. Expert coverage notes removal scenarios are rare and historically unprecedented in key respects [Result 8, NPR, discusses impeachment/removal scenarios and historical context].\\n\\n(3) Institutional hurdles make near-term removal highly unlikely. Impeachment is relatively more common, but removal requires a two‑thirds Senate vote; Section 4 requires two‑thirds of both houses to sustain. Absent a catastrophic event, these thresholds are prohibitive in the current polarized environment [Source 4 for 25th mechanisms; Result 8, NPR, on impeachment dynamics].\\n\\n(4) Forecasting and market signals are clustered around a low single‑digit to high single‑digit probability for early exit. A Manifold market on Trump resigning at any time in his second term is around 7% [Source 1]. Related Manifold markets show higher probabilities for House impeachment but much lower for removal, with a separate market on impeachment-and-removal during the term at roughly 7% (indicative for the entire term, not just by Mar 2026) [Source 10]. The Polymarket price here is ~6.6% YES, consistent with a low likelihood in this shorter window (through Mar 31, 2026).\\n\\n(5) Time horizon further reduces the chance relative to full-term risk. The window to Mar 31, 2026 is the first ~14 months of the term. Even if long‑run risks (legal, political, health) exist, concentrating them into this early period lowers the cumulative probability. While some betting commentary notes rising speculation amid economic/legal uncertainties [Source 8; Results 5 and 7], there is no credible reporting of an imminent resignation or institutional move toward permanent removal.\\n\\n(6) Legal and health uncertainties are acknowledged but lack concrete triggers for permanent removal by the deadline. Analyses outline potential legal pathways and health‑based 25th scenarios, but these remain speculative without specific, credible, near‑term developments [Result 5, Washington Post; Result 9, Guardian]. The Penn Law Review piece clarifies the mechanisms but does not indicate likelihood [Source 4].\\n\\nGiven the stringent criteria, short time frame, historical rarity, and convergent market odds, NO is the most probable outcome.\",\n  \"confidence\": 72,\n  \"confidenceReasoning\": \"(1) Convergent market indicators. Independent forecasting markets cluster around ~6–7% for resignation and similarly low single digits for removal across the entire term, with Polymarket showing ~6.6% YES for this earlier deadline [Market details in prompt; Source 1; Source 10]. This cross‑market alignment supports a NO prediction.\\n\\n(2) Strong structural priors. The constitutional and institutional thresholds for permanent removal are exceptionally high, and historical precedent is scarce to nonexistent for the relevant mechanisms [Source 4; Result 8, NPR]. These priors meaningfully bolster confidence in NO within the short window.\\n\\n(3) Data limitations temper certainty. Much of the research consists of secondary commentary, older context pieces (2023), and betting/gambling coverage without granular, up‑to‑date primary reporting on any imminent removal/resignation [Results 5, 7, 9; Source 8]. The Kalshi pages lack current pricing details (\\\"Loading...\\\") [Sources 2, 9].\\n\\n(4) Tail‑risk acknowledgment. Sudden health events, major scandals, or rapid political realignments could alter outcomes quickly; the market also resolves YES upon announcement even if effective later.

        "reasoning": "**Analyzing resignation probabilities**\n\nI'm looking into resignation probabilities, finding that a 7% chance for resignation prior to the end of term seems low, especially given that we're early in the term since it started in January 2025. The sources provide various insights: one law review piece discusses constitutional mechanisms without making predictions, while another suggests a 55% chance of impeachment by the House, but removal is much less likely. Some gambling sites are showing \"increasing odds\" due to economic factors, but they may not be the most reliable sources.**Evaluating quality and probabilities**\n\nI'm assessing quality for predictions in 2025, and it's looking low. One source gives a removal possibility by January 31, 2026, but the price isn’t clear. Another source from Metaculus about conviction before 2024 doesn’t seem relevant. I’m checking Kalshi markets, which show interest but lack details; the market price for a YES is at 6.6%. Given the timeframe until March 31, 2026, I’m thinking about setting the probability at 6-10%. For a 79-year-old male, the hazard risk of death may be around 2-3% in 14 months, which would count under removal categories.**Assessing removal risks**\n\nI'm considering the additional risks posed by legal issues. Impeachment requires a two-thirds Senate vote, which seems highly unlikely without a major scandal. The likelihood for a sustained 25th Amendment removal is even lower, needing two-thirds from both houses. Considering Trump's personality, resignation also appears low. Historically, there was only one case—Nixon, and that happened amid a serious threat of removal. For estimating the risk of death or incapacitation by March 31, 2026, it might be around 2-4%, with a more specific 2% risk in 14 months due to age factors.**Clarifying resignation and removal probabilities**\n\nI think we should really avoid using any unsourced numbers. For resignation, Manifold indicates a 7% probability for the entire term, with it being lower, around 2-3%, in the early timeframe leading to March 2026, so it’s still quite low. As for removal by impeachment, it seems extremely unlikely by that same date, largely depending on party control, which we don't have information about for 2025. Getting two-thirds Senate approval is tough, especially if Republicans maintain even a substantial minority. For invoking the 25th Amendment, that also seems improbable, probably keeping the overall probability under 10%. Setting it around 7% seems reasonable, given my confidence level of about 72%.**Assessing data quality and probabilities**\n\nI’m analyzing data quality and it seems mixed. Some credible sources, like the Penn Law Review, provide insight, but predictions from Manifold and Gambling.com are moderate. I’d rate the overall quality at around 60-65, so I'll choose 62. \n\nFor probabilities, Manifold shows a 7% chance for resignation, and 6.6% on Polymarket for a YES outcome. Impeachment odds are 55% per Manifold, but removal is less likely. Considering historical context, resignation and removal have rarely occurred, which I can support by citing NPR. Another important factor is timing—by March 31, 2026, the risk reduces, and I believe a 7% prediction aligns well with market signals. Ultimately, my confidence is at about 72%.**Crafting outcome reasoning**\n\nI need to work on the outcome reasoning, starting with resolution criteria. It's essential to outline what counts and the timeframe, referencing Polymarket’s description and Source 4. \n\nNext, I’ll highlight the historical rarity of such events, using NPR as a reference. Institutional hurdles for removal, like the 25th Amendment requiring two-thirds support, are important points to mention as well, linking back to NPR and law reviews for context.\n\nMarket signals show Polymarket pricing at 6.6% for a YES, and Manifold indicates 7% for resignation and removal, which suggests a low consensus probability; I'll cite Sources 1 and 10.\n\nConsidering the 14-month horizon until March 2026 also helps reduce risk compared to a full term. While there are speculative trends noted, the evidence isn’t strong.\n\nLegal and health concerns are present but lack sufficient evidence for invoking the 25th or removal by then—sources like WaPo and The Guardian will support this.\n\nMy confidence reasoning indicates alignment near 6-7% across markets, enhancing the signal. The historic rarity and institutional hurdles bolster my confidence.\n\nHowever, I acknowledge data gaps, including the absence of current primary signals and reliance on older commentary, which could affect my confidence level. The risk of sudden health issues or scandals introduces additional uncertainty.\n\nI’ll set the data quality rating at 62 and note all relevant sources.

As for removal by impeachment, it seems extremely unlikely by that same date, largely depending on party control, which we don't have information about for 2025. Getting two-thirds Senate approval is tough, especially if Republicans maintain even a substantial minority. For invoking the 25th Amendment, that also seems improbable, probably keeping the overall probability under 10%. Setting it around 7% seems reasonable, given my confidence level of about 72%.**Assessing data quality and probabilities**\n\nI’m analyzing data quality and it seems mixed. Some credible sources, like the Penn Law Review, provide insight, but predictions from Manifold and Gambling.com are moderate. I’d rate the overall quality at around 60-65, so I'll choose 62. \n\nFor probabilities, Manifold shows a 7% chance for resignation, and 6.6% on Polymarket for a YES outcome. Impeachment odds are 55% per Manifold, but removal is less likely. Considering historical context, resignation and removal have rarely occurred, which I can support by citing NPR. Another important factor is timing—by March 31, 2026, the risk reduces, and I believe a 7% prediction aligns well with market signals. Ultimately, my confidence is at about 72%.**Crafting outcome reasoning**\n\nI need to work on the outcome reasoning, starting with resolution criteria. It's essential to outline what counts and the timeframe, referencing Polymarket’s description and Source 4. \n\nNext, I’ll highlight the historical rarity of such events, using NPR as a reference. Institutional hurdles for removal, like the 25th Amendment requiring two-thirds support, are important points to mention as well, linking back to NPR and law reviews for context.\n\nMarket signals show Polymarket pricing at 6.6% for a YES, and Manifold indicates 7% for resignation and removal, which suggests a low consensus probability; I'll cite Sources 1 and 10.\n\nConsidering the 14-month horizon until March 2026 also helps reduce risk compared to a full term. While there are speculative trends noted, the evidence isn’t strong.\n\nLegal and health concerns are present but lack sufficient evidence for invoking the 25th or removal by then—sources like WaPo and The Guardian will support this.\n\nMy confidence reasoning indicates alignment near 6-7% across markets, enhancing the signal. The historic rarity and institutional hurdles bolster my confidence.\n\nHowever, I acknowledge data gaps, including the absence of current primary signals and reliance on older commentary, which could affect my confidence level. The risk of sudden health issues or scandals introduces additional uncertainty.\n\nI’ll set the data quality rating at 62 and note all relevant sources. Let's prepare the JSON accordingly, making sure the paragraphs are properly formatted and that the bullet points are included as needed.",
