# Will Gavin Newsom win the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination?

## AI Prediction Overview

- **Market Prediction:** [37.50%](https://polymarket.com/event/democratic-presidential-nominee-2028/will-gavin-newsom-win-the-2028-democratic-presidential-nomination-568)
- **AI Prediction:** 38%
- **AI Delta:** -0.50%
- **Confidence:** 45%

### Outcome Reasoning
Based on comprehensive analysis of polling data and political dynamics, Newsom's path to the nomination remains highly uncertain. Current evidence shows mixed signals: (1) Polymarket data indicates Newsom leads the betting market at 35% probability with $1.1M in volume, suggesting he is the current frontrunner among potential candidates. (2) However, multiple polls reveal significant challenges. An Emerson College poll (Nov 2024) showed Kamala Harris leading at 37% vs Newsom's 7%, though this was primarily name recognition-driven rather than genuine enthusiasm. (3) More concerning, a co/efficient poll (May 2025) found only 2% of voters see Newsom as the face of the Democratic Party, while 26% identified AOC and an equal 26% said 'no one.' (4) An April 2025 Emerson/Inside California Politics poll found 59% of California voters don't think Newsom should run for president. (5) Recent Morning Consult polling (June 2025) showed Newsom's support 'more than doubled' but Harris still held a strong lead. The research indicates Newsom has effectively positioned himself as Trump's foil and gained national attention through high-profile clashes (LA protests, National Guard federalization), but faces significant headwinds: concerns about being labeled a 'California liberal,' mixed reception even in his home state, and a crowded potential field including Harris, Buttigieg, Whitmer, Shapiro, and others. The Democratic Party remains fractured post-2024 losses with no clear consensus successor. While Newsom is undoubtedly a top-tier candidate with strong name recognition and political machinery, the path from frontrunner to nominee is far from guaranteed given the competitive field and lukewarm enthusiasm in some polls.

### Confidence Reasoning
Confidence is moderate-low due to several factors: (1) Temporal uncertainty - we are analyzing a 2028 event in early 2025, with nearly 3 years until the nomination, during which political landscapes can shift dramatically. (2) Data quality is mixed - while we have multiple credible polling sources (Emerson College, Morning Consult, co/efficient), the polls show contradictory results and were conducted at different times with different methodologies. Some polls focus on California voters, others on national Democratic voters, making direct comparison difficult. (3) The research includes both quantitative data (polls, betting markets) and qualitative analysis (opinion pieces, political commentary), providing good triangulation but also introducing subjective interpretation. (4) Key uncertainties remain unresolved: whether Harris will actually run, how the Democratic Party will resolve its internal divisions, whether Newsom's California record helps or hurts nationally, and how current events (Trump administration policies, economic conditions) will shape the race. (5) The Polymarket current prices (37.5% YES) and betting market data (35% for Newsom) suggest sophisticated traders also see high uncertainty. (6) Sources are recent (2023-2025) and from reputable outlets (Newsweek, CalMatters, OC Register), providing good temporal relevance. However, the lack of consensus across polls and the early stage of the race prevent higher confidence. The 45% confidence reflects genuine uncertainty rather than lack of information - we have substantial data, but it points in multiple directions.

### Key Factors
- Kamala Harris's decision on whether to run - she currently leads most polls and would be the natural frontrunner as former VP
- Newsom's ability to overcome 'California liberal' and 'coastal elite' perceptions in swing states
- Strength of opposition from other governors (Whitmer, Shapiro, Beshear, Moore) and other candidates (Buttigieg, Ossoff)
- Democratic Party unity and direction post-2024 losses - currently fractured with no clear consensus
- Newsom's performance as Trump opposition leader and whether this resonates with Democratic primary voters
- California's governance record under Newsom - both achievements and failures will be scrutinized nationally
- Fundraising capacity and political network strength - Newsom has advantages here
- Age and generational dynamics - at 60 in 2028, Newsom represents generational transition but not the youngest option
- Primary calendar and state-by-state dynamics - California's late primary may help or hurt depending on race trajectory
- Economic conditions and national mood in 2027-2028 primary season

While Harris currently leads in early polling, much of her support stems from name recognition rather than strong backing for her candidacy. Many Democrats are expressing a desire for a different candidate, with 36% preferring someone other than Harris as a leading voice for the party.\n\nNewsom has been actively positioning himself as a key player in the Democratic landscape, particularly in opposition to the Trump administration, while also signaling a willingness to collaborate when necessary. His national profile is bolstered by his energetic defense of the Biden-Harris administration and his participation in high-profile debates. With several other governors and potential candidates in the mix, Newsom's centrist approach and established presence may give him an edge in a crowded field. However, it remains uncertain whether he can secure the nomination, as the political landscape will continue to evolve leading up to the election.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- President-elect Donald Trump has yet to be sworn in, but Democrats have already begun jockeying to see who could emerge in pole position for the 2028 election. Despite Democrats’ claims to have a deep bench, there is really only one with enough of a national profile to be considered a potential front runner: California Governor Gavin Newsom. To be sure, while Vice President Kamala Harris would theoretically be the presumed front runner, her loss to Donald Trump raises doubts as to Harris’ future viability, and even her aspirations.\n- Further, with Newsom positioning himself as _the_ leader in Democrats’ impending fights with the Trump administration, his profile seems set to rise exponentially within the party. Importantly, while promising to lead the “resistance” against Trump where necessary, Newsom has also made clear that he is [open](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5027371-newsom-lines-up-resistance-to-trumps-second-term/) to working with the incoming president, likely hoping to come off as willing to put the common good over a “resistance-at-all-costs” approach.\n- Of course, this is not to disparage Harris, who stepped into an unprecedented role after President Biden withdrew from the race in late July. According to post-election [polling](https://emersoncollegepolling.com/november-2024-national-poll-trump-favorability-jumps-post-election-2028-election-kicks-off-with-harris-and-vance-leading-primaries/) from Emerson, Harris was the top choice among Democrats for 2028 (37%), well ahead of Newsom (7%). And yet, this far out from 2028, Harris’ lead is almost entirely due to name recognition, rather than a genuine desire for her to run again or a belief that she is even the best candidate to lead the party forward.\n\n### Content\n[Skip to content](https://www.ocregister.com/www.ocregister.com#content)\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom talks about the state’s border priorities at Otay Mesa on Thursday. (Nelvin C. Cepeda / The San Diego Union-Tribune)\n\nBy [Douglas Schoen](https://www.ocregister.com/author/douglas-schoen/)\n\nUPDATED: January 5, 2025 at 11:15 PM PST\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has yet to be sworn in, but Democrats have already begun jockeying to see who could emerge in pole position for the 2028 election.\n\nDespite Democrats’ claims to have a deep bench, there is really only one with enough of a national profile to be considered a potential front runner: California Governor Gavin Newsom.\n\nTo be sure, while Vice President Kamala Harris would theoretically be the presumed front runner, her loss to Donald Trump raises doubts as to Harris’ future viability, and even her aspirations.\n\nOf course, this is not to disparage Harris, who stepped into an unprecedented role after President Biden withdrew from the race in late July.

Nearly 4-in-10 (36%) Democrats said they prefer someone other than Harris to be “a leading voice for Democrats” per Echelon Insights [polling](https://echelonin.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/December-2024-Voter-Omnibus-Topline-EXTERNAL.pdf).\n\nMoreover, there are questions as to whether or not Harris is even interested in another presidential bid. _The Hill_ has reported that some Democratic i\n\n---\n\n## Source 2: Gavin Newsom Could Choose AOC as 2028 Running Mate – California Globe\nURL: https://californiaglobe.com/fr/greenberg-gavin-newsom-could-choose-aoc-as-2028-running-mate/\nPublished: 2025-09-27T00:00:00.000Z\n\n### Summary\nGavin Newsom is currently positioned as a frontrunner for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, with polls indicating he has nearly 25% support among Democratic voters. His handling of key issues and a strong national profile bolster his candidacy. However, to secure the nomination, his choice of running mate will be crucial, especially in uniting a divided party against a likely Republican opponent, Vice President JD Vance. \n\nOne potential running mate is Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC), whose progressive appeal and demographic reach could energize the Democratic base. AOC's youth and popularity among younger voters, particularly those under 45, could help mobilize critical voter segments. However, her polarizing reputation may alienate moderates and independents, posing a risk in swing states.\n\nDespite these challenges, AOC's recent collaboration with Newsom on anti-gerrymandering efforts suggests she can adapt her public persona to align with his, potentially creating a strong ticket. While some moderates prefer safer candidates, the combination of Newsom's experience and AOC's energy could be a powerful strategy for reclaiming the White House. Ultimately, Newsom's nomination hinges on his ability to navigate party dynamics and select a running mate who can effectively balance progressive enthusiasm with broader electoral appeal.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- As the faltering Democratic Party looks toward the 2028 presidential election, California Governor Gavin Newsom currently stands as the frontrunner for the party’s nomination, bolstered by his national profile and handling (controversially) of high-stakes issues like immigration and gerrymandering. With polls showing him rising to nearly 25% among Democratic voters (and betting markets like Polymarket now giving him a 20% chance of securing the nomination), Newsom’s trajectory upwards appears strong.\n- Should he clinch the nomination in a little less than 3 years from now, his choice of running mate will be pivotal in uniting a fractured party to counter the Republican field, likely led by Vice President JD Vance. Newsom could select Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) as his vice presidential running mate, leveraging her near-universal name recognition, her progressive energy and demographic appeal.\n- She would need to adapt her public tone to align with his, thereby creating a formidable ticket to reclaim the White House. AOC’s selection would make strategic sense for Newsom, who must balance ideological and demographic dynamics to rebuild the Democratic coalition post-2024 debacle. At 57, Newsom is a seasoned politician with executive experience. However, his California roots and strong of failures invite skepticism in Rust Belt swing states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, where Democrats faltered in 2024.\n\n### Content\n[Home](https://californiaglobe.com/)>[Governor](https://californiaglobe.com/topics/governor/)>Greenberg: Gavin Newsom Could Choose AOC as 2028 Running Mate\n\nA Gavin Newsom/AOC ticket?\n\n27 Sep 20253:30 am\n\nAs the faltering Democratic Party looks toward the 2028 presidential election, California Governor Gavin Newsom currently stands as the frontrunner for the party’s nomination, bolstered by his national profile and handling (controversially) of high-stakes issues like immigration and gerrymandering.

While Newsom has publicly supported Biden and denied presidential ambitions, his rising national profile and political experience position him as a notable figure in future elections. Political experts suggest that although he is unlikely to be the nominee if Biden withdraws—due to Vice President Kamala Harris's presence—Newsom's progressive credentials and extensive political network could make him a strong contender in 2028. The article also raises questions about whether a California Democrat can successfully win a presidential election, given historical perceptions.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Ron DeSantis and a heretofore unsuccessful bid for [a constitutional amendment on gun control](https://calmatters.org/politics/2024/06/gavin-newsom-guns-constitutional-amendment/). CalMatters spoke with political consultants and experts — veterans of California elections, swing state organizing and national campaigns — about Newsom’s prospects as a presidential contender. They largely agreed that he was extremely unlikely to become the Democratic nominee this year even if Biden ultimately withdraws, with Vice President Kamala Harris waiting in the wings, but that Newsom could be a strong candidate in the 2028 primary because of his progressive bona fides and extensive political network.\n- If Biden sticks around, the next Democratic presidential nominee will be chosen through the 2028 primaries. Those are decided by a more liberal subset of the electorate that may be drawn to a candidate like Newsom with a history of bold progressive governance — from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples as mayor of San Francisco in 2004 to [declaring a moratorium on executions](https://calmatters.org/justice/2019/03/gavin-newsom-halts-executions-california/) in California not long after he entered the governor’s office in 2019.\n- Gov.

Among those frequently cited is California’s own Gov.

Although he has not officially announced his candidacy, he is considered a strong potential candidate, especially in light of his opposition to President Trump's policies and his response to recent protests in California. Newsom's actions, including a lawsuit against the federalization of National Guard troops, have garnered national attention and positioned him as a key figure among Democrats. His potential competition includes notable figures like Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg. Overall, while his chances appear to be rising, the outcome remains uncertain as the primary approaches.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- [Newsletters](https://www.newsweek.com/preference-center) [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Newsweek) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/newsweek) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/newsweek) [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@newsweek) [Twitter/X](https://x.com/newsweek) [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/newsweek/) [Announcements](https://www.newsweek.com/announcements) California Governor [Gavin Newsom](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/gavin-newsom)'s chances of winning the 2028 Democratic primary increased in a second poll following the Los Angeles protests over President [Donald Trump](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/donald-trump)'s immigration policies.\n- Newsom has not formally said he's planning to run in the primary, which could draw other high profile names including former Vice President [Kamala Harris](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/kamala-harris) and former Transportation Secretary [Pete Buttigieg](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/pete-buttigieg).

Political analysts note that Biden may offer Newsom a prominent role at the Democratic nominating convention to bolster his 2028 ambitions. Despite some concerns within the Democratic Party about Biden's re-election campaign, Newsom has publicly supported Biden, indicating a commitment to the current administration. While it's uncertain if Newsom will secure the nomination, his increasing visibility and support from Biden could enhance his chances in the future.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- President Biden could offer California Governor [Gavin Newsom](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/gavin-newsom) \"a high-profile spot at the nominating convention\" to \"tee up his likely 2028 run,\" should Biden win re-election in 2024, according to a leading political scientist. The move is the latest sign in a burgeoning alliance between Biden and Newsom, who previously had a tense relationship, triggering speculation the California governor is being viewed in the White House as a natural successor for 2028.\n- Politics at King's College London, argued the blossoming alliance between Biden and Newsom is mutually beneficial and suggested it could help prepare the California governor for a presidential run in 2028. He commented: \"At this point, Biden is looking to cozy up to just about any prominent Democrat who will go on the record lavishly praising him, including Newsom.\n- Newsom is enthusiastically supporting Biden's re-election campaign, even as some [Democrats](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/democrats) are raising concerns about his candidacy [following a series of gaffes](https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-suffers-two-speech-gaffes-just-over-24-hours-1829155) by the 80-year-old president and some polling putting him [behind Republican front-runner Donald Trump](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-poll-joe-biden-washington-post-1829608). Speaking to _The New York Times_ earlier in September Newsom rejected the suggestion Democrats could nominate somebody other than Biden as their 2024 candidate, commenting: \"The train has left the station…We're all in.\n\n### Content\nBy\n\nJames Bickerton is a Newsweek U.S. News reporter based in London, U.K. His focus is on covering news and politics in Texas, as well as other general news across the United States.

His handling of the Los Angeles protests against President Trump's immigration policies has garnered national attention and praise from many Democrats, positioning him as a strong contender. Newsom's assertive response to Trump's federalization of National Guard troops, which he characterized as an abuse of power, has resonated with voters. The poll indicates that his support has increased since March, suggesting that he is gaining traction among potential Democratic candidates for the nomination.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- [Newsletters](https://www.newsweek.com/preference-center) [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Newsweek) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/newsweek) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/newsweek) [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@newsweek) [Twitter/X](https://x.com/newsweek) [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/newsweek/) [Announcements](https://www.newsweek.com/announcements) California Governor [Gavin Newsom](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/gavin-newsom)'s chances in the 2028 Democratic primary surged in the latest poll after he attracted national attention for his handling of Los Angeles protests over President [Donald Trump](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/donald-trump)'s immigration policy.\n- Still, Newsom's handling of the protests has earned praise from many Democrats, and the latest poll finds that his support against other hypothetical candidates has ticked up since March. Newsom's support more than doubled in the latest poll of Democratic voters conducted by Morning Consult, though former Vice President [Kamala Harris](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/kamala-harris) still held a strong lead over other potential candidates.\n- Newsom has long been viewed as a likely presidential candidate for [Democrats](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/democrats), and has presented himself as a foil and leading opponent to the Trump administration. The Los Angeles protests earlier presented him with perhaps his highest-profile clash against the president so far. His big moment came when Trump federalized National Guard troops, arguing local officials were not doing enough to quell demonstrations that at times grew violent, though most protesters were peaceful.\n\n### Content\n- Nation\n\n[News](https://www.newsweek.com/news) [Politics](https://www.newsweek.com/politics) [Tech](https://www.newsweek.com/technology) [Fact Check](https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check) [Personal Finance](https://www.newsweek.com/personal-finance) [Automotive](https://www.newsweek.com/autos) [Sports](https://www.newsweek.com/sports) [Better Workplaces](https://www.newsweek.com/better-workplaces)\n\n- World\n\n[Russia-Ukraine](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/russia) [Middle East](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/middle-east) [China And Asia](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/china) [Better Planet](https://www.newsweek.com/better-planet) [All World News](https://www.newsweek.com/world)\n\n- Lifestyle\n\n[Family & Parenting](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/parenting) [Entertainment](https://www.newsweek.com/entertainment) [Travel](https://www.newsweek.com/travel) [Pets](https://www.newsweek.com/pets) [Relationships](https://www.newsweek.com/relationships) [Science](https://www.newsweek.com/tech-science) [Health](https://www.newsweek.com/health)\n\n- Opinion\n\n[My Turn](https://www.newsweek.com/my-turn) [All Opinion](https://www.newsweek.com/opinion)\n\n- Rankings\n\n[Health](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/health) [Finance](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/finance) [Products](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/products-services) [Education](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/education) [Workplaces](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/work) [Corporate Responsibility](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/corporate-responsibility) [All Rankings](https://rankings.newsweek.com/)\n\n- Connect\n\n[Newsletters](https://www.newsweek.com/preference-center) [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Newsweek) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/newsweek) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/newsweek) [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@newsweek) [Twitter/X](https://x.com/newsweek) [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/newsweek/) [Announcements](https://www.newsweek.com/announcements)\n\n- Mo\n\n---\n\n## Source 7: Gavin Newsom's 2028 Hopes Dim According to New Poll\nURL: https://newsweek.com/gavin-newsom-2028-election-odds-poll-2072809\nPublished: 2025-05-15T17:09:08.000Z\nAuthor: Martha McHardy\n\n### Summary\nGavin Newsom's prospects for winning the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination appear dim, according to a recent poll conducted by co/efficient. The survey, which included 1,462 likely voters, revealed that only 2% view Newsom as the face of the Democratic Party. In contrast, 26% of respondents identified New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as the party's leading figure, with an equal percentage stating that \"no one\" represents the party. Although Newsom has not officially declared his candidacy, his ability to emerge as a unifying candidate in the post-Trump era is under scrutiny, especially following recent electoral setbacks for the Democratic Party.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Newsom has not said whether he plans to run for the White House, but has long been rumored to be considering a 2028 bid. But Newsom's ability to position himself as a unifying or compelling figure for the post-Trump era could be called into question. Following election losses across the board in 2024, the Democratic Party has gone through infighting and struggled to unify around a clear successor at the top leading for some calls to rally behind a new generation of leadership.\n- [Newsletters](https://www.newsweek.com/preference-center) [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Newsweek) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/newsweek) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/newsweek) [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@newsweek) [Twitter/X](https://x.com/newsweek) [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/newsweek/) [Announcements](https://www.newsweek.com/announcements) A new poll, conducted by co/efficient between May 7 and May 9 among 1,462 likely voters, found that just 2 percent of voters see Newsom as the face of the [Democratic Party](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/democratic-party). The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points.\n- But these attempts to broaden his appeal appear to have fallen flat, some polls showing little appetite for a 2028 bid from Newsom. \"Democratic leaders who are willing to fight Trump are being rewarded by voters; those who are giving in on core values are being reviled.\" An Emerson College Polling/Inside California Politics/ _The Hill_ [survey](https://emersoncollegepolling.com/april-2025-california-poll-harris-leads-hypothetical-gubernatorial-primary-50-of-voters-think-she-should-not-run/), conducted between April 12 and April 14, 2025, among 1,000 California registered voters, found that 59 percent of respondents said they don't think that Newsom should run for president in 2028, with 41 percent supporting a bid for the Oval Office.\n\n### Content\n- Nation\n\n[News](https://www.newsweek.com/news) [Politics](https://www.newsweek.com/politics) [Tech](https://www.newsweek.com/technology) [Fact Check](https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check) [Personal Finance](https://www.newsweek.com/personal-finance) [Automotive](https://www.newsweek.com/autos) [Sports](https://www.newsweek.com/sports) [Better Workplaces](https://www.newsweek.com/better-workplaces)\n\n- World\n\n[Russia-Ukraine](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/russia) [Middle East](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/middle-east) [China And Asia](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/china) [Better Planet](https://www.newsweek.com/better-planet) [All World News](https://www.newsweek.com/world)\n\n- Lifestyle\n\n[Family & Parenting](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/parenting) [Entertainment](https://www.newsweek.com/entertainment) [Travel](https://www.newsweek.com/travel) [Pets](https://www.newsweek.com/pets) [Relationships](https://www.newsweek.com/relationships) [Science](https://www.newsweek.com/tech-science) [Health](https://www.newsweek.com/health)\n\n- Opinion\n\n[My Turn](https://www.newsweek.com/my-turn) [All Opinion](https://www.newsweek.com/opinion)\n\n- Rankings\n\n[Health](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/health) [Finance](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/finance) [Products](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/products-services) [Education](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/education) [Workplaces](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/work) [Corporate Responsibility](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/corporate-responsibility) [All Rankings](https://rankings.newsweek.com/)\n\n- Connect\n\n[Newsletters](https://www.newsweek.com/preference-center) [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Newsweek) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/newsweek) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/newsweek) [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@newsweek) [Twitter/X](https://x.com/newsweek) [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/newsweek/) [Announcements](https://www.newsweek.com/announcements)\n\n- Mo\n\n---\n\n## Source 8: Polymarket | Democratic Presidential Nominee 2028\nURL: https://polymarket.com/event/democratic-presidential-nominee-2028/will-gavin-newsom-win-the-2028-democratic-presidential-nomination-568\nPublished: 2025-07-11T18:41:17.000Z\n\n### Summary\nGavin Newsom currently leads the betting market for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination with a 35% probability and a trading volume of $1,110,536.

(3) The research includes both quantitative data (polls, betting markets) and qualitative analysis (opinion pieces, political commentary), providing good triangulation but also introducing subjective interpretation. (4) Key uncertainties remain unresolved: whether Harris will actually run, how the Democratic Party will resolve its internal divisions, whether Newsom's California record helps or hurts nationally, and how current events (Trump administration policies, economic conditions) will shape the race. (5) The Polymarket current prices (37.5% YES) and betting market data (35% for Newsom) suggest sophisticated traders also see high uncertainty. (6) Sources are recent (2023-2025) and from reputable outlets (Newsweek, CalMatters, OC Register), providing good temporal relevance. However, the lack of consensus across polls and the early stage of the race prevent higher confidence. The 45% confidence reflects genuine uncertainty rather than lack of information - we have substantial data, but it points in multiple directions."

While Harris currently leads in early polling, much of her support stems from name recognition rather than strong backing for her candidacy. Many Democrats are expressing a desire for a different candidate, with 36% preferring someone other than Harris as a leading voice for the party.\n\nNewsom has been actively positioning himself as a key player in the Democratic landscape, particularly in opposition to the Trump administration, while also signaling a willingness to collaborate when necessary. His national profile is bolstered by his energetic defense of the Biden-Harris administration and his participation in high-profile debates. With several other governors and potential candidates in the mix, Newsom's centrist approach and established presence may give him an edge in a crowded field. However, it remains uncertain whether he can secure the nomination, as the political landscape will continue to evolve leading up to the election.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- President-elect Donald Trump has yet to be sworn in, but Democrats have already begun jockeying to see who could emerge in pole position for the 2028 election. Despite Democrats’ claims to have a deep bench, there is really only one with enough of a national profile to be considered a potential front runner: California Governor Gavin Newsom. To be sure, while Vice President Kamala Harris would theoretically be the presumed front runner, her loss to Donald Trump raises doubts as to Harris’ future viability, and even her aspirations.\n- Further, with Newsom positioning himself as _the_ leader in Democrats’ impending fights with the Trump administration, his profile seems set to rise exponentially within the party. Importantly, while promising to lead the “resistance” against Trump where necessary, Newsom has also made clear that he is [open](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5027371-newsom-lines-up-resistance-to-trumps-second-term/) to working with the incoming president, likely hoping to come off as willing to put the common good over a “resistance-at-all-costs” approach.\n- Of course, this is not to disparage Harris, who stepped into an unprecedented role after President Biden withdrew from the race in late July. According to post-election [polling](https://emersoncollegepolling.com/november-2024-national-poll-trump-favorability-jumps-post-election-2028-election-kicks-off-with-harris-and-vance-leading-primaries/) from Emerson, Harris was the top choice among Democrats for 2028 (37%), well ahead of Newsom (7%). And yet, this far out from 2028, Harris’ lead is almost entirely due to name recognition, rather than a genuine desire for her to run again or a belief that she is even the best candidate to lead the party forward.\n\n### Content\n[Skip to content](https://www.ocregister.com/www.ocregister.com#content)\n\nCalifornia Gov.

His handling of key issues and a strong national profile bolster his candidacy. However, to secure the nomination, his choice of running mate will be crucial, especially in uniting a divided party against a likely Republican opponent, Vice President JD Vance. \n\nOne potential running mate is Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC), whose progressive appeal and demographic reach could energize the Democratic base. AOC's youth and popularity among younger voters, particularly those under 45, could help mobilize critical voter segments. However, her polarizing reputation may alienate moderates and independents, posing a risk in swing states.\n\nDespite these challenges, AOC's recent collaboration with Newsom on anti-gerrymandering efforts suggests she can adapt her public persona to align with his, potentially creating a strong ticket. While some moderates prefer safer candidates, the combination of Newsom's experience and AOC's energy could be a powerful strategy for reclaiming the White House. Ultimately, Newsom's nomination hinges on his ability to navigate party dynamics and select a running mate who can effectively balance progressive enthusiasm with broader electoral appeal.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- As the faltering Democratic Party looks toward the 2028 presidential election, California Governor Gavin Newsom currently stands as the frontrunner for the party’s nomination, bolstered by his national profile and handling (controversially) of high-stakes issues like immigration and gerrymandering. With polls showing him rising to nearly 25% among Democratic voters (and betting markets like Polymarket now giving him a 20% chance of securing the nomination), Newsom’s trajectory upwards appears strong.\n- Should he clinch the nomination in a little less than 3 years from now, his choice of running mate will be pivotal in uniting a fractured party to counter the Republican field, likely led by Vice President JD Vance. Newsom could select Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) as his vice presidential running mate, leveraging her near-universal name recognition, her progressive energy and demographic appeal.\n- She would need to adapt her public tone to align with his, thereby creating a formidable ticket to reclaim the White House. AOC’s selection would make strategic sense for Newsom, who must balance ideological and demographic dynamics to rebuild the Democratic coalition post-2024 debacle. At 57, Newsom is a seasoned politician with executive experience. However, his California roots and strong of failures invite skepticism in Rust Belt swing states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, where Democrats faltered in 2024.\n\n### Content\n[Home](https://californiaglobe.com/)>[Governor](https://californiaglobe.com/topics/governor/)>Greenberg: Gavin Newsom Could Choose AOC as 2028 Running Mate\n\nA Gavin Newsom/AOC ticket?\n\n27 Sep 20253:30 am\n\nAs the faltering Democratic Party looks toward the 2028 presidential election, California Governor Gavin Newsom currently stands as the frontrunner for the party’s nomination, bolstered by his national profile and handling (controversially) of high-stakes issues like immigration and gerrymandering.

While Newsom has publicly supported Biden and denied presidential ambitions, his rising national profile and political experience position him as a notable figure in future elections. Political experts suggest that although he is unlikely to be the nominee if Biden withdraws—due to Vice President Kamala Harris's presence—Newsom's progressive credentials and extensive political network could make him a strong contender in 2028. The article also raises questions about whether a California Democrat can successfully win a presidential election, given historical perceptions.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Ron DeSantis and a heretofore unsuccessful bid for [a constitutional amendment on gun control](https://calmatters.org/politics/2024/06/gavin-newsom-guns-constitutional-amendment/). CalMatters spoke with political consultants and experts — veterans of California elections, swing state organizing and national campaigns — about Newsom’s prospects as a presidential contender. They largely agreed that he was extremely unlikely to become the Democratic nominee this year even if Biden ultimately withdraws, with Vice President Kamala Harris waiting in the wings, but that Newsom could be a strong candidate in the 2028 primary because of his progressive bona fides and extensive political network.\n- If Biden sticks around, the next Democratic presidential nominee will be chosen through the 2028 primaries. Those are decided by a more liberal subset of the electorate that may be drawn to a candidate like Newsom with a history of bold progressive governance — from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples as mayor of San Francisco in 2004 to [declaring a moratorium on executions](https://calmatters.org/justice/2019/03/gavin-newsom-halts-executions-california/) in California not long after he entered the governor’s office in 2019.\n- Gov.

Among those frequently cited is California’s own Gov.

Although he has not officially announced his candidacy, he is considered a strong potential candidate, especially in light of his opposition to President Trump's policies and his response to recent protests in California. Newsom's actions, including a lawsuit against the federalization of National Guard troops, have garnered national attention and positioned him as a key figure among Democrats. His potential competition includes notable figures like Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg. Overall, while his chances appear to be rising, the outcome remains uncertain as the primary approaches.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- [Newsletters](https://www.newsweek.com/preference-center) [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Newsweek) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/newsweek) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/newsweek) [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@newsweek) [Twitter/X](https://x.com/newsweek) [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/newsweek/) [Announcements](https://www.newsweek.com/announcements) California Governor [Gavin Newsom](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/gavin-newsom)'s chances of winning the 2028 Democratic primary increased in a second poll following the Los Angeles protests over President [Donald Trump](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/donald-trump)'s immigration policies.\n- Newsom has not formally said he's planning to run in the primary, which could draw other high profile names including former Vice President [Kamala Harris](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/kamala-harris) and former Transportation Secretary [Pete Buttigieg](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/pete-buttigieg).

Political analysts note that Biden may offer Newsom a prominent role at the Democratic nominating convention to bolster his 2028 ambitions. Despite some concerns within the Democratic Party about Biden's re-election campaign, Newsom has publicly supported Biden, indicating a commitment to the current administration.

His big moment came when Trump federalized National Guard troops, arguing local officials were not doing enough to quell demonstrations that at times grew violent, though most protesters were peaceful.\n\n### Content\n- Nation\n\n[News](https://www.newsweek.com/news) [Politics](https://www.newsweek.com/politics) [Tech](https://www.newsweek.com/technology) [Fact Check](https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check) [Personal Finance](https://www.newsweek.com/personal-finance) [Automotive](https://www.newsweek.com/autos) [Sports](https://www.newsweek.com/sports) [Better Workplaces](https://www.newsweek.com/better-workplaces)\n\n- World\n\n[Russia-Ukraine](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/russia) [Middle East](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/middle-east) [China And Asia](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/china) [Better Planet](https://www.newsweek.com/better-planet) [All World News](https://www.newsweek.com/world)\n\n- Lifestyle\n\n[Family & Parenting](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/parenting) [Entertainment](https://www.newsweek.com/entertainment) [Travel](https://www.newsweek.com/travel) [Pets](https://www.newsweek.com/pets) [Relationships](https://www.newsweek.com/relationships) [Science](https://www.newsweek.com/tech-science) [Health](https://www.newsweek.com/health)\n\n- Opinion\n\n[My Turn](https://www.newsweek.com/my-turn) [All Opinion](https://www.newsweek.com/opinion)\n\n- Rankings\n\n[Health](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/health) [Finance](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/finance) [Products](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/products-services) [Education](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/education) [Workplaces](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/work) [Corporate Responsibility](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/corporate-responsibility) [All Rankings](https://rankings.newsweek.com/)\n\n- Connect\n\n[Newsletters](https://www.newsweek.com/preference-center) [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Newsweek) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/newsweek) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/newsweek) [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@newsweek) [Twitter/X](https://x.com/newsweek) [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/newsweek/) [Announcements](https://www.newsweek.com/announcements)\n\n- Mo\n\n---\n\n## Source 7: Gavin Newsom's 2028 Hopes Dim According to New Poll\nURL: https://newsweek.com/gavin-newsom-2028-election-odds-poll-2072809\nPublished: 2025-05-15T17:09:08.000Z\nAuthor: Martha McHardy\n\n### Summary\nGavin Newsom's prospects for winning the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination appear dim, according to a recent poll conducted by co/efficient. The survey, which included 1,462 likely voters, revealed that only 2% view Newsom as the face of the Democratic Party. In contrast, 26% of respondents identified New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as the party's leading figure, with an equal percentage stating that \"no one\" represents the party. Although Newsom has not officially declared his candidacy, his ability to emerge as a unifying candidate in the post-Trump era is under scrutiny, especially following recent electoral setbacks for the Democratic Party.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Newsom has not said whether he plans to run for the White House, but has long been rumored to be considering a 2028 bid. But Newsom's ability to position himself as a unifying or compelling figure for the post-Trump era could be called into question. Following election losses across the board in 2024, the Democratic Party has gone through infighting and struggled to unify around a clear successor at the top leading for some calls to rally behind a new generation of leadership.\n- [Newsletters](https://www.newsweek.com/preference-center) [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Newsweek) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/newsweek) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/newsweek) [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@newsweek) [Twitter/X](https://x.com/newsweek) [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/newsweek/) [Announcements](https://www.newsweek.com/announcements) A new poll, conducted by co/efficient between May 7 and May 9 among 1,462 likely voters, found that just 2 percent of voters see Newsom as the face of the [Democratic Party](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/democratic-party). The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points.\n- But these attempts to broaden his appeal appear to have fallen flat, some polls showing little appetite for a 2028 bid from Newsom. \"Democratic leaders who are willing to fight Trump are being rewarded by voters; those who are giving in on core values are being reviled.\" An Emerson College Polling/Inside California Politics/ _The Hill_ [survey](https://emersoncollegepolling.com/april-2025-california-poll-harris-leads-hypothetical-gubernatorial-primary-50-of-voters-think-she-should-not-run/), conducted between April 12 and April 14, 2025, among 1,000 California registered voters, found that 59 percent of respondents said they don't think that Newsom should run for president in 2028, with 41 percent supporting a bid for the Oval Office.\n\n### Content\n- Nation\n\n[News](https://www.newsweek.com/news) [Politics](https://www.newsweek.com/politics) [Tech](https://www.newsweek.com/technology) [Fact Check](https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check) [Personal Finance](https://www.newsweek.com/personal-finance) [Automotive](https://www.newsweek.com/autos) [Sports](https://www.newsweek.com/sports) [Better Workplaces](https://www.newsweek.com/better-workplaces)\n\n- World\n\n[Russia-Ukraine](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/russia) [Middle East](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/middle-east) [China And Asia](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/china) [Better Planet](https://www.newsweek.com/better-planet) [All World News](https://www.newsweek.com/world)\n\n- Lifestyle\n\n[Family & Parenting](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/parenting) [Entertainment](https://www.newsweek.com/entertainment) [Travel](https://www.newsweek.com/travel) [Pets](https://www.newsweek.com/pets) [Relationships](https://www.newsweek.com/relationships) [Science](https://www.newsweek.com/tech-science) [Health](https://www.newsweek.com/health)\n\n- Opinion\n\n[My Turn](https://www.newsweek.com/my-turn) [All Opinion](https://www.newsweek.com/opinion)\n\n- Rankings\n\n[Health](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/health) [Finance](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/finance) [Products](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/products-services) [Education](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/education) [Workplaces](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/work) [Corporate Responsibility](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/corporate-responsibility) [All Rankings](https://rankings.newsweek.com/)\n\n- Connect\n\n[Newsletters](https://www.newsweek.com/preference-center) [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Newsweek) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/newsweek) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/newsweek) [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@newsweek) [Twitter/X](https://x.com/newsweek) [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/newsweek/) [Announcements](https://www.newsweek.com/announcements)\n\n- Mo\n\n---\n\n## Source 8: Polymarket | Democratic Presidential Nominee 2028\nURL: https://polymarket.com/event/democratic-presidential-nominee-2028/will-gavin-newsom-win-the-2028-democratic-presidential-nomination-568\nPublished: 2025-07-11T18:41:17.000Z\n\n### Summary\nGavin Newsom currently leads the betting market for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination with a 35% probability and a trading volume of $1,110,536.

Current evidence shows mixed signals: (1) Polymarket data indicates Newsom leads the betting market at 35% probability with $1.1M in volume, suggesting he is the current frontrunner among potential candidates. (2) However, multiple polls reveal significant challenges. An Emerson College poll (Nov 2024) showed Kamala Harris leading at 37% vs Newsom's 7%, though this was primarily name recognition-driven rather than genuine enthusiasm. (3) More concerning, a co/efficient poll (May 2025) found only 2% of voters see Newsom as the face of the Democratic Party, while 26% identified AOC and an equal 26% said 'no one.' (4) An April 2025 Emerson/Inside California Politics poll found 59% of California voters don't think Newsom should run for president. (5) Recent Morning Consult polling (June 2025) showed Newsom's support 'more than doubled' but Harris still held a strong lead. The research indicates Newsom has effectively positioned himself as Trump's foil and gained national attention through high-profile clashes (LA protests, National Guard federalization), but faces significant headwinds: concerns about being labeled a 'California liberal,' mixed reception even in his home state, and a crowded potential field including Harris, Buttigieg, Whitmer, Shapiro, and others. The Democratic Party remains fractured post-2024 losses with no clear consensus successor. While Newsom is undoubtedly a top-tier candidate with strong name recognition and political machinery, the path from frontrunner to nominee is far from guaranteed given the competitive field and lukewarm enthusiasm in some polls.\",\n    \"confidence\": 45,\n    \"confidenceReasoning\": \"Confidence is moderate-low due to several factors: (1) Temporal uncertainty - we are analyzing a 2028 event in early 2025, with nearly 3 years until the nomination, during which political landscapes can shift dramatically. (2) Data quality is mixed - while we have multiple credible polling sources (Emerson College, Morning Consult, co/efficient), the polls show contradictory results and were conducted at different times with different methodologies. Some polls focus on California voters, others on national Democratic voters, making direct comparison difficult. (3) The research includes both quantitative data (polls, betting markets) and qualitative analysis (opinion pieces, political commentary), providing good triangulation but also introducing subjective interpretation. (4) Key uncertainties remain unresolved: whether Harris will actually run, how the Democratic Party will resolve its internal divisions, whether Newsom's California record helps or hurts nationally, and how current events (Trump administration policies, economic conditions) will shape the race. (5) The Polymarket current prices (37.5% YES) and betting market data (35% for Newsom) suggest sophisticated traders also see high uncertainty. (6) Sources are recent (2023-2025) and from reputable outlets (Newsweek, CalMatters, OC Register), providing good temporal relevance. However, the lack of consensus across polls and the early stage of the race prevent higher confidence. The 45% confidence reflects genuine uncertainty rather than lack of information - we have substantial data, but it points in multiple directions.\",\n    \"probability\": 38\n  },\n  \"keyFactors\": [\n    \"Kamala Harris's decision on whether to run - she currently leads most polls and would be the natural frontrunner as former VP\",\n    \"Newsom's ability to overcome 'California liberal' and 'coastal elite' perceptions in swing states\",\n    \"Strength of opposition from other governors (Whitmer, Shapiro, Beshear, Moore) and other candidates (Buttigieg, Ossoff)\",\n    \"Democratic Party unity and direction post-2024 losses - currently fractured with no clear consensus\",\n    \"Newsom's performance as Trump opposition leader and whether this resonates with Democratic primary voters\",\n    \"California's governance record under Newsom - both achievements and failures will be scrutinized nationally\",\n    \"Fundraising capacity and political network strength - Newsom has advantages here\",\n    \"Age and generational dynamics - at 60 in 2028, Newsom represents generational transition but not the youngest option\",\n    \"Primary calendar and state-by-state dynamics - California's late primary may help or hurt depending on race trajectory\",\n    \"Economic conditions and national mood in 2027-2028 primary season\"\n  ],\n  \"dataQuality\": \"MEDIUM\",\n  \"lastUpdated\": \"2025-01-10T00:00:00Z\"\n}\n```",
