## AI Prediction Overview

- Market Prediction: 6.60%
- AI Prediction: 8%
- Confidence: 72%
- AI Prediction Delta: 1.40%

### Key Factors
- Constitutional thresholds for removal (impeachment conviction; sustained 25th Amendment Section 4) are exceptionally high [Source 4]
- Market-implied odds for resignation/removal are in single digits (e.g., Manifold resignation ~7%) [Source 1]
- Impeachment risk does not equate to removal; markets suggest much lower odds for conviction/removal [Source 10; Source 7]
- Short time window to March 31, 2026 reduces pathways for a completed, permanent removal
- Mortality/health risk contributes non-zero probability but remains relatively low over the horizon [Grok Result 3]
- Lack of current, credible reporting indicating imminent resignation or bipartisan removal action [Grok Results 1–10]
- Early announcement clause could resolve YES, but no evidence of such a pending announcement

### Outcome Reasoning
(1) Structural hurdles to removal are extremely high. Permanent removal by impeachment requires a two‑thirds Senate conviction; a sustained 25th Amendment Section 4 requires two‑thirds in both chambers. These thresholds are historically prohibitive and have never resulted in a president’s permanent ouster via Section 4, and only once via resignation following near‑certain conviction (Nixon). Legal analysis underscores how Section 4 would work and why it’s rarely viable absent overwhelming bipartisan consensus [Source 4].

(2) Cross‑market signals point to single‑digit odds of early exit. A Manifold market prices a voluntary resignation during the term at roughly 7% [Source 1]. Related markets show impeachment risk can be moderate, but actual removal remains in the single digits (e.g., “impeached and removed” references at low levels) [Source 10; Source 7]. Kalshi has comparable markets framed to the same resolution criterion (ceasing to be President by Mar 31, 2026), but there is no indication of elevated odds beyond low single digits in current public summaries [Source 2; Source 9]. The Polymarket order book cited in the market info shows YES at 6.6%, consistent with these signals.

(3) Short timeline and base rates favor completion. The market window ends March 31, 2026 (~16 months from now). Historically, presidents almost always remain in office during such periods absent extraordinary events. While analyses speculate that legal or health issues could trigger removal or resignation [Grok Results 1–10], these are largely pre‑election, broad commentaries without concrete, contemporaneous indicators of imminent removal. A sustained Section 4 action or impeachment‑and‑conviction by this deadline would require rapid, bipartisan alignment that current reporting does not substantiate.

Supporting considerations:
- Only permanent removal qualifies; temporary 25th Amendment use would not count (market rules). A sustained Section 4 is exceptionally unlikely [Source 4].
- Economic/legal/headline risk is real but speculative in the sources provided (e.g., CNN, WaPo, BBC, Guardian pre‑2024 analyses) and not tied to actionable, current removal processes [Grok Results 1–8].
- Death or permanent incapacity would qualify, but actuarial probability over this window, while non‑zero, is still relatively low and already embedded in market pricing (contributing a few percentage points at most) [Grok Result 3; general base rates).

Citations:
- Constitutional/25th Amendment process and thresholds: [Source 4]
- Resignation market estimate ~7%: [Source 1]
- Impeachment vs. removal market context (impeached and removed in low single digits; impeachment alone higher): [Source 10; Source 7]
- Broad media analyses on potential removal mechanisms (contextual, speculative): [Grok Results 1–10]

### Confidence Reasoning
(1) Convergent low-probability pricing across platforms. Multiple prediction venues imply single-digit probabilities for resignation/removal within the term or by similar horizons [Source 1; Source 10; Polymarket price 6.6% in market details], supporting a NO lean with moderate confidence.

(2) Strong structural constraints with clear legal grounding. The constitutional mechanics (impeachment conviction; sustained Section 4) are well-defined and historically rare, which reduces uncertainty in the absence of concrete, credible signals of imminent action [Source 4].

(3) Data limitations temper certainty. Much of the supplemental media content is from 2023 and is speculative rather than tied to real-time proceedings [Grok Results 1–10]. Kalshi pages referenced do not provide accessible live pricing in the provided snapshots [Source 2; Source 9]. One off-platform article (Gambling.com) is secondary and not authoritative for probabilities [Source 8]. These factors cap confidence below high levels.

Net assessment:
- Strengths: Clear rules; robust historical base rates; legal scholarship on processes [Source 4]; aligned market odds [Source 1; Source 10; current Polymarket price].
- Weaknesses: Limited up-to-date, primary reporting on concrete removal pathways; several sources are generic/older or lack data depth.

Data Quality: 58

## Market Overview

- Question: Trump out as President by March 31?
- Market: [View on Polymarket](https://polymarket.com/event/73968/trump-out-as-president-by-march-31)
- Market ID: 666860
- Description: This market will resolve to “Yes” if Donald Trump resigns or is removed as President or otherwise ceases to be the President of the United States for any period of time by March 31, 2026, 11:59 PM ET. Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No”.

An announcement of Donald Trump's resignation/removal before this market's end date will immediately resolve this market to "Yes", regardless of when the announced resignation/removal goes into effect.

Only permanent removal from office will qualify. Temporary removal (e.g. temporary invocation of the 25th Amendment under Section 3 or a Section 4 invocation not sustained by both Houses of Congress) or impeachment without removal will not count.

A sustained invocation of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment, Section 4 (i.e., if both Houses of Congress, by two-thirds vote, uphold the Vice President and Cabinet’s determination of presidential inability) will qualify for a "Yes" resolution. 

The resolution source for this market will be a consensus of credible reporting.

It argues that the Constitution mandates the president to personally oversee the executive branch, and severe impairments can constitute a breach of this duty. The author proposes that if a president is unable to perform their responsibilities, they must either resign or transfer power to the Vice President under the Twenty-Fifth Amendment. If the president refuses to do so, the Vice President and Cabinet are empowered to act, and if they do not, Congress must consider impeachment. This framework delineates when removal is constitutionally required versus optional.\n\nIn the context of your query regarding Donald Trump's potential removal from office by March 31, 2026, this article provides a legal basis for understanding how presidential disability could lead to resignation or removal. If Trump's impairments were deemed severe enough to breach his constitutional duties, the outlined processes could be invoked to address his capacity to serve as president.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- [Skip to main content](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol173/iss2/5/#main)\n\n- [Home](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu)\n- [About](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/about.html)\n- [FAQ](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/faq.html)\n- [My Account](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/myaccount.cgi?context=)\n\n[Home](https://scholarship.law.upen\n\n### Content\n[Skip to main content](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol173/iss2/5/#main)\n\n- [Home](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu)\n- [About](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/about.html)\n- [FAQ](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/faq.html)\n- [My Account](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/myaccount.cgi?context=)\n\n[Home](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu)\n\\> [Penn Carey Law Journals](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/pennlawjnls)\n\\> [PENN\\_LAW\\_REVIEW](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review)\n\\> [Vol. 173 (2024-2025)](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol173)\n\\> [Iss. 2 (2025)](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol173/iss2)\n\n# [Presidential Disability and Mandatory Removal](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=9878&context=penn_law_review)\n\n## Authors\n\n[**Ari Goldstein**, _University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School L'25_](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/do/search/?q=author%3A%22Ari%20Goldstein%22&start=0&context=3571832)\n\n## Publication Date\n\nWinter 2025\n\n## First Page\n\n593\n\n## Document Type\n\nComment\n\n## Abstract\n\nPresidents often develop physical and mental impairments during their tenure in the White House.

Joe Short\n\n### Summary\nThe article discusses the increasing odds of Donald Trump potentially losing his position as President of the United States before the next election. Factors contributing to this uncertainty include a struggling U.S. economy impacted by Trump's tariffs, which have led to significant losses for American companies and investor anxiety. As a result, betting markets are adjusting their odds, reflecting a growing belief that Trump may not complete his second term. The situation is fluid, with ongoing negotiations regarding tariffs and trade policies that could influence his presidency. If you are specifically inquiring about whether Trump will be out of office by March 31, 2026, the current sentiment suggests that there is a notable chance of this occurring due to the economic pressures and political climate.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- # How Long Will Donald Trump Last As US President?\n\n[![](https://gambling.com/cdn-cgi/image/w=100,h=100,format=auto,fit=cover/https://objects.kaxmedia.com/auto/o/54370/04de3ccc25.png)](https://www.gambling.com/uk/authors/joe-short) Article By\n\nJoe Short\n\n![Author Image](https://gambling.com/cdn-cgi/image/w=72px,h=72px,format=webp/https://objects.kaxmedia.com\n\n### Content\n# How Long Will Donald Trump Last As US President?\n\n[![](https://gambling.com/cdn-cgi/image/w=100,h=100,format=auto,fit=cover/https://objects.kaxmedia.com/auto/o/54370/04de3ccc25.png)](https://www.gambling.com/uk/authors/joe-short) Article By\n\nJoe Short\n\n![Author Image](https://gambling.com/cdn-cgi/image/w=72px,h=72px,format=webp/https://objects.kaxmedia.com/auto/o/54370/04de3ccc25.png)[Joe Short](https://www.gambling.com/uk/authors/joe-short)\n\n[![Twitter Icon](https://gambling.com/cdn-cgi/image/w=32px,h=32px,format=webp/https://objects.kaxmedia.com/auto/o/170635/a0d37fd7a0.svg)](https://twitter.com/_jshort) ![Copy Link Icon](https://gambling.com/cdn-cgi/image/w=32px,h=32px,format=webp/https://objects.kaxmedia.com/auto/o/175799/d01e3142ee.svg)\n\nUrl copied!\n\n[Joe Short](https://www.gambling.com/uk/authors/joe-short)\n\nLast Updated: **Apr 22, 2025**\n\nShare On Your Network\n\n- ![Twitter Icon](https://objects.kaxmedia.com/auto/o/170635/a0d37fd7a0.svg)\n- ![Facebook Icon](https://objects.kaxmedia.com/auto/o/170636/bdfd559b51.svg)\n- ![Linkedin Icon](https://objects.kaxmedia.com/auto/o/170634/e5126256ac.svg)\n- ![Email Icon](https://objects.kaxmedia.com/auto/o/200912/204a798f10.svg)\n- ![](https://objects.kaxmedia.com/auto/o/175799/d01e3142ee.svg)Url copied!\n\n![How Long Will Donald Trump Last As US President?](https://gambling.com/cdn-cgi/image/w=1200,h=675,format=auto,fit=cover/https://objects.kaxmedia.com/genesis/donald-trump-november-2024.webp?v=c5654684a669c7722e6cd99553cf65909304bef\n\n---\n\n## Source 9: President impeached | Trade on Kalshi\nURL: https://kalshi.com/markets/kximpeach/president-impeached\nPublished: 2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\n\n### Summary\nThe Kalshi market on the impeachment of the President allows users to speculate on whether Donald Trump will cease to be President by March 31, 2026. The market will resolve to \"Yes\" if he resigns, is removed, or otherwise no longer holds the office for any duration by that date.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- [Live](https://kalshi.com/calendar) [Ideas](https://kalshi.com/ideas/feed)\n\nLoading...\n\n### Content\n[Live](https://kalshi.com/calendar) [Ideas](https://kalshi.com/ideas/feed)\n\nLoading...\n\n---\n\n## Source 10: Will Donald Trump be impeached during his second term?\nURL: https://manifold.markets/MattP/will-donald-trump-be-impeached-duri\nPublished: 2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\n\n### Summary\nThe webpage discusses the likelihood of Donald Trump being impeached during his potential second term as President. Currently, there is a 55% chance predicted for his impeachment by the House of Representatives, similar to his previous two impeachments. The question specifically focuses on impeachment, not on whether he would be convicted by the Senate. The market will resolve to \"Yes\" if he is officially impeached, and it will resolve to \"N/A\" if he does not win the presidency again. \n\nFor your query regarding whether Trump will be out as President by March 31, 2026, the relevant market indicates that it will resolve to \"Yes\" if he resigns, is removed, or otherwise ceases to be President by that date. The current discussions and predictions do not directly address this specific timeline but focus on the impeachment probabilities.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Open options\n\nWill Donald Trump be impeached during his second term?\n\n[Matt P](https://manifold.markets/MattP)\n\n254\n10kṀ65k\n\n2029\n\n55%\n\nchance\n\n1H\n\n6H\n\n1D\n\n1W\n\n1M\n\nALL\n\nBet YESBet NO\n\nQuestion resolves based on him being officially impeached by the House (as he was twice during his first term); conviction by the Senate does not affect this question one way o\n\n### Content\nOpen options\n\nWill Donald Trump be impeached during his second term?\n\n[Matt P](https://manifold.markets/MattP)\n\n254\n10kṀ65k\n\n2029\n\n55%\n\nchance\n\n1H\n\n6H\n\n1D\n\n1W\n\n1M\n\nALL\n\nBet YESBet NO\n\nQuestion resolves based on him being officially impeached by the House (as he was twice during his first term); conviction by the Senate does not affect this question one way or the other.\n\nResolves N/A in the (now quite unlikely) event that he does not win.\n\nThis question is managed and resolved by Manifold.\n\n[Trump](https://manifold.markets/news/what-will-trump-do)\n\n[US Politics](https://manifold.markets/topic/us-politics)\n\n[Politics](https://manifold.markets/topic/politics-default)\n\n[Trump](https://manifold.markets/topic/donald-trump)\n\n[Republican Party](https://manifold.markets/topic/magaland)\n\n[2024 US Presidential Election](https://manifold.markets/topic/2024-us-presidential-election)\n\n[US Democracy](https://manifold.markets/topic/us-democracy)\n\nFollow\n\nSign upGet\n1,000\nto start trading!\n\n## People are also trading\n\n[Will Trump invoke the Insurrection Act during his second term?\\\n\\\nFranklin Baldo\\\n\\\n56% chance](https://manifold.markets/FranklinBaldo/will-trump-invoke-the-insurrection) [Will Donald Trump be impeached and removed during his second term?\\\n\\\ncshunter\\\n\\\n7% chance](https://manifold.markets/cash/will-donald-trump-be-impeached-and) [Will Trump be impeached for a third (total) time during his second term?\\\n\\\nAryeh Zax\\\n\\\n47% chance](https://manifold.markets/zax/will-trump-be-impea\n\n---\n\n# Grok Web Search Results\n\nThe following search results provide additional real-time context:\n\n## Result 1: Trump's 2024 Campaign Faces Legal Hurdles\nURL: https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/15/us/politics/trump-2024-campaign.html\nSource: The New York Times\nPublished: 2023-09-15T14:30:00Z\n\nDonald Trump's bid for the 2024 presidency is complicated by ongoing legal challenges, including indictments related to the 2020 election and classified documents.

Permanent removal by impeachment requires a two‑thirds Senate conviction; a sustained 25th Amendment Section 4 requires two‑thirds in both chambers. These thresholds are historically prohibitive and have never resulted in a president’s permanent ouster via Section 4, and only once via resignation following near‑certain conviction (Nixon). Legal analysis underscores how Section 4 would work and why it’s rarely viable absent overwhelming bipartisan consensus [Source 4].\\n\\n(2) Cross‑market signals point to single‑digit odds of early exit. A Manifold market prices a voluntary resignation during the term at roughly 7% [Source 1]. Related markets show impeachment risk can be moderate, but actual removal remains in the single digits (e.g., “impeached and removed” references at low levels) [Source 10; Source 7]. Kalshi has comparable markets framed to the same resolution criterion (ceasing to be President by Mar 31, 2026), but there is no indication of elevated odds beyond low single digits in current public summaries [Source 2; Source 9]. The Polymarket order book cited in the market info shows YES at 6.6%, consistent with these signals.\\n\\n(3) Short timeline and base rates favor completion. The market window ends March 31, 2026 (~16 months from now). Historically, presidents almost always remain in office during such periods absent extraordinary events. While analyses speculate that legal or health issues could trigger removal or resignation [Grok Results 1–10], these are largely pre‑election, broad commentaries without concrete, contemporaneous indicators of imminent removal. A sustained Section 4 action or impeachment‑and‑conviction by this deadline would require rapid, bipartisan alignment that current reporting does not substantiate.\\n\\nSupporting considerations:\\n- Only permanent removal qualifies; temporary 25th Amendment use would not count (market rules). A sustained Section 4 is exceptionally unlikely [Source 4].\\n- Economic/legal/headline risk is real but speculative in the sources provided (e.g., CNN, WaPo, BBC, Guardian pre‑2024 analyses) and not tied to actionable, current removal processes [Grok Results 1–8].\\n- Death or permanent incapacity would qualify, but actuarial probability over this window, while non‑zero, is still relatively low and already embedded in market pricing (contributing a few percentage points at most) [Grok Result 3; general base rates).\\n\\nCitations:\\n- Constitutional/25th Amendment process and thresholds: [Source 4]\\n- Resignation market estimate ~7%: [Source 1]\\n- Impeachment vs. removal market context (impeached and removed in low single digits; impeachment alone higher): [Source 10; Source 7]\\n- Broad media analyses on potential removal mechanisms (contextual, speculative): [Grok Results 1–10]\",\n  \"confidence\": 72,\n  \"confidenceReasoning\": \"(1) Convergent low-probability pricing across platforms. Multiple prediction venues imply single-digit probabilities for resignation/removal within the term or by similar horizons [Source 1; Source 10; Polymarket price 6.6% in market details], supporting a NO lean with moderate confidence.\\n\\n(2) Strong structural constraints with clear legal grounding. The constitutional mechanics (impeachment conviction; sustained Section 4) are well-defined and historically rare, which reduces uncertainty in the absence of concrete, credible signals of imminent action [Source 4].\\n\\n(3) Data limitations temper certainty. Much of the supplemental media content is from 2023 and is speculative rather than tied to real-time proceedings [Grok Results 1–10]. Kalshi pages referenced do not provide accessible live pricing in the provided snapshots [Source 2; Source 9]. One off-platform article (Gambling.com) is secondary and not authoritative for probabilities [Source 8].

I plan to estimate a probability of 9% for a \"YES,\" aligning it with a market price of around 6.6%, adjusting slightly to 8%. My confidence might sit at 70%, but given the data quality is low, I might raise it to 72%. The data quality score could be around 58 due to mixed-source reliability, with some credible but outdated information. Important factors include constitutional thresholds and uncertain party control.**Evaluating mortality risk**\n\nThe description notes that \"ceases to be President\" covers any period of absence, including death, which qualifies as a permanent removal. Trump's age in 2025 is 79, and by March 2026, he'll be 80. Considering mortality risk for someone his age over 16 months could be around 3-4%, which contributes to the probability. I need to be cautious about discussing mortality directly, but I can mention health risks generally without being morbid. While I can't browse for new data, I'll rely on general actuarial stats as reasoning.**Calculating probabilities**\n\nI can cite relevant information, noting that any announcement before the market end date resolves a \"YES\" regardless of when a resignation or removal takes effect. This could slightly increase the probability if a step-down was scheduled, though that seems unlikely. I propose a probability of 10%, broken down as follows: death/incapacity risk at 3-5%, resignation at 1-2%, and removal via impeachment or the 25th Amendment at just 1-2%.

      "Market-implied odds for resignation/removal are in single digits (e.g., Manifold resignation ~7%) [Source 1]",

      "Short time window to March 31, 2026 reduces pathways for a completed, permanent removal",
      "Mortality/health risk contributes non-zero probability but remains relatively low over the horizon [Grok Result 3]",

    "probability": 8,
    "outcomeReasoning": "(1) Structural hurdles to removal are extremely high. Permanent removal by impeachment requires a two‑thirds Senate conviction; a sustained 25th Amendment Section 4 requires two‑thirds in both chambers. These thresholds are historically prohibitive and have never resulted in a president’s permanent ouster via Section 4, and only once via resignation following near‑certain conviction (Nixon). Legal analysis underscores how Section 4 would work and why it’s rarely viable absent overwhelming bipartisan consensus [Source 4].\n\n(2) Cross‑market signals point to single‑digit odds of early exit. A Manifold market prices a voluntary resignation during the term at roughly 7% [Source 1]. Related markets show impeachment risk can be moderate, but actual removal remains in the single digits (e.g., “impeached and removed” references at low levels) [Source 10; Source 7]. Kalshi has comparable markets framed to the same resolution criterion (ceasing to be President by Mar 31, 2026), but there is no indication of elevated odds beyond low single digits in current public summaries [Source 2; Source 9]. The Polymarket order book cited in the market info shows YES at 6.6%, consistent with these signals.\n\n(3) Short timeline and base rates favor completion. The market window ends March 31, 2026 (~16 months from now). Historically, presidents almost always remain in office during such periods absent extraordinary events. While analyses speculate that legal or health issues could trigger removal or resignation [Grok Results 1–10], these are largely pre‑election, broad commentaries without concrete, contemporaneous indicators of imminent removal. A sustained Section 4 action or impeachment‑and‑conviction by this deadline would require rapid, bipartisan alignment that current reporting does not substantiate.\n\nSupporting considerations:\n- Only permanent removal qualifies; temporary 25th Amendment use would not count (market rules). A sustained Section 4 is exceptionally unlikely [Source 4].\n- Economic/legal/headline risk is real but speculative in the sources provided (e.g., CNN, WaPo, BBC, Guardian pre‑2024 analyses) and not tied to actionable, current removal processes [Grok Results 1–8].\n- Death or permanent incapacity would qualify, but actuarial probability over this window, while non‑zero, is still relatively low and already embedded in market pricing (contributing a few percentage points at most) [Grok Result 3; general base rates).\n\nCitations:\n- Constitutional/25th Amendment process and thresholds: [Source 4]\n- Resignation market estimate ~7%: [Source 1]\n- Impeachment vs. removal market context (impeached and removed in low single digits; impeachment alone higher): [Source 10; Source 7]\n- Broad media analyses on potential removal mechanisms (contextual, speculative): [Grok Results 1–10]",

    "confidenceReasoning": "(1) Convergent low-probability pricing across platforms. Multiple prediction venues imply single-digit probabilities for resignation/removal within the term or by similar horizons [Source 1; Source 10; Polymarket price 6.6% in market details], supporting a NO lean with moderate confidence.\n\n(2) Strong structural constraints with clear legal grounding. The constitutional mechanics (impeachment conviction; sustained Section 4) are well-defined and historically rare, which reduces uncertainty in the absence of concrete, credible signals of imminent action [Source 4].\n\n(3) Data limitations temper certainty. Much of the supplemental media content is from 2023 and is speculative rather than tied to real-time proceedings [Grok Results 1–10]. Kalshi pages referenced do not provide accessible live pricing in the provided snapshots [Source 2; Source 9]. One off-platform article (Gambling.com) is secondary and not authoritative for probabilities [Source 8]. These factors cap confidence below high levels.\n\nNet assessment:\n- Strengths: Clear rules; robust historical base rates; legal scholarship on processes [Source 4]; aligned market odds [Source 1; Source 10; current Polymarket price].\n- Weaknesses: Limited up-to-date, primary reporting on concrete removal pathways; several sources are generic/older or lack data depth."

Temporary removal (e.g. temporary invocation of the 25th Amendment under Section 3 or a Section 4 invocation not sustained by both Houses of Congress) or impeachment without removal will not count.\n\nA sustained invocation of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment, Section 4 (i.e., if both Houses of Congress, by two-thirds vote, uphold the Vice President and Cabinet’s determination of presidential inability) will qualify for a \"Yes\" resolution. \n\nThe resolution source for this market will be a consensus of credible reporting.\n\n## Market Details\n- Market ID: 666860\n- Condition ID: 0xfc9ee9c25abd5b966088767214c22dcf3ad1c72548e9a1dbef9d4328c170e5b5\n- Active: Yes\n- Closed: No\n- Current Volume: 21986.262442\n- Current Liquidity: 24623.34753\n- Current Outcome Prices: YES: 6.6%, NO: 93.4%\n\n---\n\n# Web Research Data\n\nThe following information was gathered from web research to provide context for this prediction:\n\n## Source 1: Will Trump resign prior to the end of his term?\nURL: https://manifold.markets/TotalVerb/will-trump-resign-prior-to-the-end\nPublished: 2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\n\n### Summary\nThe webpage discusses a betting market regarding whether Donald Trump will resign before the end of his second term.

It argues that the Constitution mandates the president to personally oversee the executive branch, and severe impairments can constitute a breach of this duty. The author proposes that if a president is unable to perform their responsibilities, they must either resign or transfer power to the Vice President under the Twenty-Fifth Amendment. If the president refuses to do so, the Vice President and Cabinet are empowered to act, and if they do not, Congress must consider impeachment. This framework delineates when removal is constitutionally required versus optional.\n\nIn the context of your query regarding Donald Trump's potential removal from office by March 31, 2026, this article provides a legal basis for understanding how presidential disability could lead to resignation or removal. If Trump's impairments were deemed severe enough to breach his constitutional duties, the outlined processes could be invoked to address his capacity to serve as president.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- [Skip to main content](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol173/iss2/5/#main)\n\n- [Home](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu)\n- [About](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/about.html)\n- [FAQ](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/faq.html)\n- [My Account](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/myaccount.cgi?context=)\n\n[Home](https://scholarship.law.upen\n\n### Content\n[Skip to main content](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol173/iss2/5/#main)\n\n- [Home](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu)\n- [About](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/about.html)\n- [FAQ](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/faq.html)\n- [My Account](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/myaccount.cgi?context=)\n\n[Home](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu)\n\\> [Penn Carey Law Journals](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/pennlawjnls)\n\\> [PENN\\_LAW\\_REVIEW](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review)\n\\> [Vol. 173 (2024-2025)](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol173)\n\\> [Iss. 2 (2025)](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol173/iss2)\n\n# [Presidential Disability and Mandatory Removal](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=9878&context=penn_law_review)\n\n## Authors\n\n[**Ari Goldstein**, _University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School L'25_](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/do/search/?q=author%3A%22Ari%20Goldstein%22&start=0&context=3571832)\n\n## Publication Date\n\nWinter 2025\n\n## First Page\n\n593\n\n## Document Type\n\nComment\n\n## Abstract\n\nPresidents often develop physical and mental impairments during their tenure in the White House.

Joe Short\n\n### Summary\nThe article discusses the increasing odds of Donald Trump potentially losing his position as President of the United States before the next election. Factors contributing to this uncertainty include a struggling U.S. economy impacted by Trump's tariffs, which have led to significant losses for American companies and investor anxiety. As a result, betting markets are adjusting their odds, reflecting a growing belief that Trump may not complete his second term. The situation is fluid, with ongoing negotiations regarding tariffs and trade policies that could influence his presidency. If you are specifically inquiring about whether Trump will be out of office by March 31, 2026, the current sentiment suggests that there is a notable chance of this occurring due to the economic pressures and political climate.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- # How Long Will Donald Trump Last As US President?\n\n[![](https://gambling.com/cdn-cgi/image/w=100,h=100,format=auto,fit=cover/https://objects.kaxmedia.com/auto/o/54370/04de3ccc25.png)](https://www.gambling.com/uk/authors/joe-short) Article By\n\nJoe Short\n\n![Author Image](https://gambling.com/cdn-cgi/image/w=72px,h=72px,format=webp/https://objects.kaxmedia.com\n\n### Content\n# How Long Will Donald Trump Last As US President?\n\n[![](https://gambling.com/cdn-cgi/image/w=100,h=100,format=auto,fit=cover/https://objects.kaxmedia.com/auto/o/54370/04de3ccc25.png)](https://www.gambling.com/uk/authors/joe-short) Article By\n\nJoe Short\n\n![Author Image](https://gambling.com/cdn-cgi/image/w=72px,h=72px,format=webp/https://objects.kaxmedia.com/auto/o/54370/04de3ccc25.png)[Joe Short](https://www.gambling.com/uk/authors/joe-short)\n\n[![Twitter Icon](https://gambling.com/cdn-cgi/image/w=32px,h=32px,format=webp/https://objects.kaxmedia.com/auto/o/170635/a0d37fd7a0.svg)](https://twitter.com/_jshort) ![Copy Link Icon](https://gambling.com/cdn-cgi/image/w=32px,h=32px,format=webp/https://objects.kaxmedia.com/auto/o/175799/d01e3142ee.svg)\n\nUrl copied!\n\n[Joe Short](https://www.gambling.com/uk/authors/joe-short)\n\nLast Updated: **Apr 22, 2025**\n\nShare On Your Network\n\n- ![Twitter Icon](https://objects.kaxmedia.com/auto/o/170635/a0d37fd7a0.svg)\n- ![Facebook Icon](https://objects.kaxmedia.com/auto/o/170636/bdfd559b51.svg)\n- ![Linkedin Icon](https://objects.kaxmedia.com/auto/o/170634/e5126256ac.svg)\n- ![Email Icon](https://objects.kaxmedia.com/auto/o/200912/204a798f10.svg)\n- ![](https://objects.kaxmedia.com/auto/o/175799/d01e3142ee.svg)Url copied!\n\n![How Long Will Donald Trump Last As US President?](https://gambling.com/cdn-cgi/image/w=1200,h=675,format=auto,fit=cover/https://objects.kaxmedia.com/genesis/donald-trump-november-2024.webp?v=c5654684a669c7722e6cd99553cf65909304bef\n\n---\n\n## Source 9: President impeached | Trade on Kalshi\nURL: https://kalshi.com/markets/kximpeach/president-impeached\nPublished: 2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\n\n### Summary\nThe Kalshi market on the impeachment of the President allows users to speculate on whether Donald Trump will cease to be President by March 31, 2026.

Experts suggest these cases could impact his ability to serve if elected, potentially leading to removal from office. Political analysts predict a possible resolution before 2026, but outcomes remain uncertain.\n\n---\n\n## Result 2: How Trump's Legal Woes Could End His Political Career\nURL: https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/10/01/trump-legal-battles-2024/\nSource: The Washington Post\nPublished: 2023-10-01T09:00:00Z\n\nRecent court decisions in Trump's cases may prevent him from holding office again, with appeals ongoing through 2024.

Permanent removal by impeachment requires a two‑thirds Senate conviction; a sustained 25th Amendment Section 4 requires two‑thirds in both chambers. These thresholds are historically prohibitive and have never resulted in a president’s permanent ouster via Section 4, and only once via resignation following near‑certain conviction (Nixon). Legal analysis underscores how Section 4 would work and why it’s rarely viable absent overwhelming bipartisan consensus [Source 4].\\n\\n(2) Cross‑market signals point to single‑digit odds of early exit. A Manifold market prices a voluntary resignation during the term at roughly 7% [Source 1]. Related markets show impeachment risk can be moderate, but actual removal remains in the single digits (e.g., “impeached and removed” references at low levels) [Source 10; Source 7]. Kalshi has comparable markets framed to the same resolution criterion (ceasing to be President by Mar 31, 2026), but there is no indication of elevated odds beyond low single digits in current public summaries [Source 2; Source 9]. The Polymarket order book cited in the market info shows YES at 6.6%, consistent with these signals.\\n\\n(3) Short timeline and base rates favor completion. The market window ends March 31, 2026 (~16 months from now). Historically, presidents almost always remain in office during such periods absent extraordinary events. While analyses speculate that legal or health issues could trigger removal or resignation [Grok Results 1–10], these are largely pre‑election, broad commentaries without concrete, contemporaneous indicators of imminent removal. A sustained Section 4 action or impeachment‑and‑conviction by this deadline would require rapid, bipartisan alignment that current reporting does not substantiate.\\n\\nSupporting considerations:\\n- Only permanent removal qualifies; temporary 25th Amendment use would not count (market rules). A sustained Section 4 is exceptionally unlikely [Source 4].\\n- Economic/legal/headline risk is real but speculative in the sources provided (e.g., CNN, WaPo, BBC, Guardian pre‑2024 analyses) and not tied to actionable, current removal processes [Grok Results 1–8].\\n- Death or permanent incapacity would qualify, but actuarial probability over this window, while non‑zero, is still relatively low and already embedded in market pricing (contributing a few percentage points at most) [Grok Result 3; general base rates).\\n\\nCitations:\\n- Constitutional/25th Amendment process and thresholds: [Source 4]\\n- Resignation market estimate ~7%: [Source 1]\\n- Impeachment vs. removal market context (impeached and removed in low single digits; impeachment alone higher): [Source 10; Source 7]\\n- Broad media analyses on potential removal mechanisms (contextual, speculative): [Grok Results 1–10]\",\n  \"confidence\": 72,\n  \"confidenceReasoning\": \"(1) Convergent low-probability pricing across platforms. Multiple prediction venues imply single-digit probabilities for resignation/removal within the term or by similar horizons [Source 1; Source 10; Polymarket price 6.6% in market details], supporting a NO lean with moderate confidence.\\n\\n(2) Strong structural constraints with clear legal grounding. The constitutional mechanics (impeachment conviction; sustained Section 4) are well-defined and historically rare, which reduces uncertainty in the absence of concrete, credible signals of imminent action [Source 4].\\n\\n(3) Data limitations temper certainty. Much of the supplemental media content is from 2023 and is speculative rather than tied to real-time proceedings [Grok Results 1–10]. Kalshi pages referenced do not provide accessible live pricing in the provided snapshots [Source 2; Source 9]. One off-platform article (Gambling.com) is secondary and not authoritative for probabilities [Source 8]. These factors cap confidence below high levels.\\n\\nNet assessment:\\n- Strengths: Clear rules; robust historical base rates; legal scholarship on processes [Source 4]; aligned market odds [Source 1; Source 10; current Polymarket price].\\n- Weaknesses: Limited up-to-date, primary reporting on concrete removal pathways; several sources are generic/older or lack data depth.\",\n  \"probability\": 8,\n  \"keyFactors\": [\n    \"Constitutional thresholds for removal (impeachment conviction; sustained 25th Amendment Section 4) are exceptionally high [Source 4]\",\n    \"Market-implied odds for resignation/removal are in single digits (e.g., Manifold resignation ~7%) [Source 1]\",\n    \"Impeachment risk does not equate to removal; markets suggest much lower odds for conviction/removal [Source 10; Source 7]\",\n    \"Short time window to March 31, 2026 reduces pathways for a completed, permanent removal\",\n    \"Mortality/health risk contributes non-zero probability but remains relatively low over the horizon [Grok Result 3]\",\n    \"Lack of current, credible reporting indicating imminent resignation or bipartisan removal action [Grok Results 1–10]\",\n    \"Early announcement clause could resolve YES, but no evidence of such a pending announcement\"\n  ],\n  \"dataQuality\": 58,\n  \"lastUpdated\": \"2025-11-13T00:00:00Z\"\n}",

          "reasoning": "**Assessing low probability predictions**\n\nI need to reference sources to support the low probability claims. Source 1 shows a 7% resignation rate, while Source 10 indicates a 55% impeachment probability, but that’s just for impeachment. Source 7 mentions a market about potential impeachment and removal by January 31, 2026, but I lack details. The Kalshi links are loading but suggest similar markets price low probabilities. I’ll structure the information with points, paragraphs, bullet lists, and citations. Finally, I’ll make sure to include a timestamp of \"2025-11-13T00:00:00Z\".**Considering probability estimates**\n\nI can cite the existence of relevant data but need to be cautious about making claims regarding current events that aren't supported by research. I shouldn’t assert anything about current congressional control unless it’s backed by my findings. I plan to estimate a probability of 9% for a \"YES,\" aligning it with a market price of around 6.6%, adjusting slightly to 8%. My confidence might sit at 70%, but given the data quality is low, I might raise it to 72%. The data quality score could be around 58 due to mixed-source reliability, with some credible but outdated information. Important factors include constitutional thresholds and uncertain party control.**Evaluating mortality risk**\n\nThe description notes that \"ceases to be President\" covers any period of absence, including death, which qualifies as a permanent removal. Trump's age in 2025 is 79, and by March 2026, he'll be 80. Considering mortality risk for someone his age over 16 months could be around 3-4%, which contributes to the probability. I need to be cautious about discussing mortality directly, but I can mention health risks generally without being morbid. While I can't browse for new data, I'll rely on general actuarial stats as reasoning.**Calculating probabilities**\n\nI can cite relevant information, noting that any announcement before the market end date resolves a \"YES\" regardless of when a resignation or removal takes effect. This could slightly increase the probability if a step-down was scheduled, though that seems unlikely. I propose a probability of 10%, broken down as follows: death/incapacity risk at 3-5%, resignation at 1-2%, and removal via impeachment or the 25th Amendment at just 1-2%. A rough sum falls around 6-9%, so I’ll set it at 8% to account for the mortality component. My confidence is moderate due to the lack of recent high-quality sources, but the constitutional thresholds provide solid reasoning.",

It argues that the Constitution mandates the president to personally oversee the executive branch, and severe impairments can constitute a breach of this duty. The author proposes that if a president is unable to perform their responsibilities, they must either resign or transfer power to the Vice President under the Twenty-Fifth Amendment. If the president refuses to do so, the Vice President and Cabinet are empowered to act, and if they do not, Congress must consider impeachment. This framework delineates when removal is constitutionally required versus optional.\n\nIn the context of your query regarding Donald Trump's potential removal from office by March 31, 2026, this article provides a legal basis for understanding how presidential disability could lead to resignation or removal.

Joe Short\n\n### Summary\nThe article discusses the increasing odds of Donald Trump potentially losing his position as President of the United States before the next election. Factors contributing to this uncertainty include a struggling U.S. economy impacted by Trump's tariffs, which have led to significant losses for American companies and investor anxiety. As a result, betting markets are adjusting their odds, reflecting a growing belief that Trump may not complete his second term. The situation is fluid, with ongoing negotiations regarding tariffs and trade policies that could influence his presidency. If you are specifically inquiring about whether Trump will be out of office by March 31, 2026, the current sentiment suggests that there is a notable chance of this occurring due to the economic pressures and political climate.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- # How Long Will Donald Trump Last As US President?\n\n[![](https://gambling.com/cdn-cgi/image/w=100,h=100,format=auto,fit=cover/https://objects.kaxmedia.com/auto/o/54370/04de3ccc25.png)](https://www.gambling.com/uk/authors/joe-short) Article By\n\nJoe Short\n\n![Author Image](https://gambling.com/cdn-cgi/image/w=72px,h=72px,format=webp/https://objects.kaxmedia.com\n\n### Content\n# How Long Will Donald Trump Last As US President?\n\n[![](https://gambling.com/cdn-cgi/image/w=100,h=100,format=auto,fit=cover/https://objects.kaxmedia.com/auto/o/54370/04de3ccc25.png)](https://www.gambling.com/uk/authors/joe-short) Article By\n\nJoe Short\n\n![Author Image](https://gambling.com/cdn-cgi/image/w=72px,h=72px,format=webp/https://objects.kaxmedia.com/auto/o/54370/04de3ccc25.png)[Joe Short](https://www.gambling.com/uk/authors/joe-short)\n\n[![Twitter Icon](https://gambling.com/cdn-cgi/image/w=32px,h=32px,format=webp/https://objects.kaxmedia.com/auto/o/170635/a0d37fd7a0.svg)](https://twitter.com/_jshort) ![Copy Link Icon](https://gambling.com/cdn-cgi/image/w=32px,h=32px,format=webp/https://objects.kaxmedia.com/auto/o/175799/d01e3142ee.svg)\n\nUrl copied!\n\n[Joe Short](https://www.gambling.com/uk/authors/joe-short)\n\nLast Updated: **Apr 22, 2025**\n\nShare On Your Network\n\n- ![Twitter Icon](https://objects.kaxmedia.com/auto/o/170635/a0d37fd7a0.svg)\n- ![Facebook Icon](https://objects.kaxmedia.com/auto/o/170636/bdfd559b51.svg)\n- ![Linkedin Icon](https://objects.kaxmedia.com/auto/o/170634/e5126256ac.svg)\n- ![Email Icon](https://objects.kaxmedia.com/auto/o/200912/204a798f10.svg)\n- ![](https://objects.kaxmedia.com/auto/o/175799/d01e3142ee.svg)Url copied!\n\n![How Long Will Donald Trump Last As US President?](https://gambling.com/cdn-cgi/image/w=1200,h=675,format=auto,fit=cover/https://objects.kaxmedia.com/genesis/donald-trump-november-2024.webp?v=c5654684a669c7722e6cd99553cf65909304bef\n\n---\n\n## Source 9: President impeached | Trade on Kalshi\nURL: https://kalshi.com/markets/kximpeach/president-impeached\nPublished: 2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\n\n### Summary\nThe Kalshi market on the impeachment of the President allows users to speculate on whether Donald Trump will cease to be President by March 31, 2026.

## Source 4: Presidential Disability and Mandatory Removal
URL: https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol173/iss2/5/
Published: 2025-02-13T00:00:00.000Z

### Summary
The article "Presidential Disability and Mandatory Removal" by Ari Goldstein discusses the constitutional implications of a president's physical or mental impairments that affect their ability to fulfill their duties. It argues that the Constitution mandates the president to personally oversee the executive branch, and severe impairments can constitute a breach of this duty. The author proposes that if a president is unable to perform their responsibilities, they must either resign or transfer power to the Vice President under the Twenty-Fifth Amendment. If the president refuses to do so, the Vice President and Cabinet are empowered to act, and if they do not, Congress must consider impeachment. This framework delineates when removal is constitutionally required versus optional.

In the context of your query regarding Donald Trump's potential removal from office by March 31, 2026, this article provides a legal basis for understanding how presidential disability could lead to resignation or removal. If Trump's impairments were deemed severe enough to breach his constitutional duties, the outlined processes could be invoked to address his capacity to serve as president.

## Abstract

Presidents often develop physical and mental impairments during their tenure in the White House.

Author: Article By Joe Short Joe Short Url copied! Joe Short

### Summary
The article discusses the increasing odds of Donald Trump potentially losing his position as President of the United States before the next election. Factors contributing to this uncertainty include a struggling U.S. economy impacted by Trump's tariffs, which have led to significant losses for American companies and investor anxiety. As a result, betting markets are adjusting their odds, reflecting a growing belief that Trump may not complete his second term. The situation is fluid, with ongoing negotiations regarding tariffs and trade policies that could influence his presidency. If you are specifically inquiring about whether Trump will be out of office by March 31, 2026, the current sentiment suggests that there is a notable chance of this occurring due to the economic pressures and political climate.

For your query regarding whether Trump will be out as President by March 31, 2026, the relevant market indicates that it will resolve to "Yes" if he resigns, is removed, or otherwise ceases to be President by that date.
