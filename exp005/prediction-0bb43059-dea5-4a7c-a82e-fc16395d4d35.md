# Will A Minecraft Movie be the top grossing movie of 2025?

## AI Prediction Overview

- **AI Prediction Delta:** +32.80%
- **Confidence:** 72%
- **Market Prediction:** [35.20%](https://polymarket.com/event/highest-grossing-movie-in-2025/will-a-minecraft-movie-be-the-top-grossing-movie-of-2025)
- **AI Prediction:** 68%

### Key Factors
- Record-breaking $162.75M domestic opening weekend, biggest of 2025
- Already exceeded $800M+ worldwide gross by mid-April
- First 2025 Hollywood film to cross $500M globally
- Strong appeal to Gen Z demographic (33% of audience)
- Viral social media presence sustaining interest
- Early April release provides head start for calendar year accumulation
- Competition from upcoming summer and holiday tentpole releases
- Historic over-performance pattern for video game adaptations
- Current lead of ~$74M over nearest competitor (Captain America)
- Market odds showing skepticism despite strong performance data

### Outcome Reasoning
(1) A Minecraft Movie has demonstrated exceptional box office performance that positions it as the frontrunner for 2025's top-grossing film. According to CNN Business (April 6, 2025), the film opened with $162.75 million domestically, marking the biggest opening weekend of the year and surpassing Disney's 'Captain America: Brave New World' which opened at $88.5 million. This represents a massive over-performance against initial projections of $60-65 million.

(2) The film's total gross trajectory is extremely strong. Box Office Mojo data shows worldwide gross of approximately $909.7 million ($408.7 million domestic, $501 million international), while Sportskeeda reports the film had already reached $816 million as of mid-April 2025. The film became the first Hollywood release of 2025 to cross the $500 million mark globally, demonstrating sustained audience interest beyond the opening weekend.

(3) Historical context from Bloomberg (April 13, 2025) indicates that recent blockbusters including Moana 2, Inside Out 2, and The Super Mario Bros. Movie significantly exceeded forecasts, with Inside Out 2 opening $54 million above estimates. A Minecraft Movie follows this pattern of video game and family-friendly adaptations over-performing, suggesting strong legs throughout 2025.

(4) The film's appeal to the critical Gen Z demographic (33% of opening weekend audience per Celluloid Junkie) and its viral social media presence on TikTok provide ongoing marketing momentum that should sustain box office performance through the year. The film has already surpassed its $150 million production budget by over 5.4 times according to multiple sources.

(5) While competition exists from upcoming releases like Mission Impossible 8 and How To Train Your Dragon, A Minecraft Movie's early April release date provides a significant head start in accumulating total calendar year gross. The market resolution criteria specifically focuses on 2025 calendar year domestic gross, where the film currently leads by a substantial margin.

### Confidence Reasoning
(1) Data quality is high with multiple credible sources (CNN Business, Box Office Mojo, Bloomberg) providing consistent box office figures. The $162.75 million opening weekend is well-documented across sources, and the film's performance through mid-April shows strong sustainability with totals exceeding $800 million globally.

(2) However, several uncertainties reduce absolute confidence:
• We are still relatively early in 2025 (April data available), with 8+ months remaining for competing releases
• Major tentpole releases scheduled for summer and holiday seasons could potentially challenge the lead
• The research doesn't provide comprehensive information about all major 2025 releases and their projected performance

(3) The current market odds (35.2% YES, 64.8% NO) suggest significant skepticism, which may indicate insider knowledge or awareness of upcoming releases not fully captured in the research. This discrepancy between strong performance data and market sentiment warrants caution.

(4) Positive factors supporting confidence:
• The film has already achieved historic milestones (highest-grossing video game adaptation opening in Australia, biggest 2025 opening)
• Strong international performance ($501 million) provides diversified revenue streams
• Family-friendly PG rating aligns with highest-grossing films historically
• Sustained viral marketing and cultural relevance beyond opening weekend

(5) The 72% confidence reflects strong current evidence favoring YES while acknowledging meaningful uncertainty from unknown future competition and the long timeframe remaining in 2025. The substantial gap between the film's current performance and its nearest 2025 competitor provides a cushion, but not enough for extremely high confidence given the calendar year ahead.

URL: https://www.imdb.com/news/ni65214774/?ref_=nwc_art_perm
Published: 2025-04-04T00:00:00.000Z

### Summary
"A Minecraft Movie" is projected to earn between $70 million and $80 million in its domestic opening weekend, with some estimates suggesting it could reach as high as $90 million due to strong advanced ticket sales. The film, produced by Warner Bros. and Legendary, is expected to add over $65 million internationally, bringing its global total to approximately $135 million to $150 million. While the film's production cost was $150 million, its appeal stems from the popularity of the Minecraft franchise and its multigenerational fanbase. Despite the challenges of adapting video games into films, "A Minecraft Movie" is anticipated to be a commercial success, but whether it will be the top-grossing movie of 2025 remains uncertain as it competes with other major releases throughout the year.

### Key Highlights
- [Warner Bros.](https://www.imdb.com/company/co0026840/) and Legendary’s cinematic take on the beloved video game is targeting $70 million to $80 million in its domestic opening weekend. Based on surging advanced ticket sales, rivals and independent tracking services believe the final number could be closer to $90 million, while Warner Bros. is offering a softer $65 million figure. “ [A Minecraft Movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3566834/)” should add another $65 million-plus at the international box office for a grand total of $135 million to $150 million globally to start.
- The film cost $150 million to produce and plenty more to market. Thanks to pent-up demand, multigenerational appeal and goodwill toward the choose-your-own-adventure property, however, “ [A Minecraft Movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3566834/)” looks like it’ll be a commercial winner for Warner Bros. and movie theaters. Although it’s based on one of the best-selling video games in history, that kind of association doesn’t always guarantee success in Hollywood.

### Summary
"A Minecraft Movie" has made a significant impact at the box office, grossing nearly $163 million during its opening weekend, surpassing initial projections of $60 million and later estimates of $100 million. This performance marks it as the biggest opening weekend of 2025, outpacing Disney's "Captain America: Brave New World," which previously held the record with $88.5 million. 

Given its strong start and the growing popularity of video game adaptations, "A Minecraft Movie" has the potential to become the top-grossing film of the year. Analysts note that the film appeals to a broad audience, particularly younger viewers, and its PG rating aligns with successful trends in the genre. The film's success comes at a time when overall box office earnings are down, providing a much-needed boost to the industry.

While it's too early to definitively say it will be the top-grossing movie of 2025, its record-breaking opening suggests it is well-positioned to compete for that title as the year progresses.

### Key Highlights
- “A Minecraft Movie” surged past the opening weekend of Disney’s “Captain America: Brave New World,” which had been the top opener of 2025 with an opening weekend of $88.5 million. “Pre-sales and interest accelerated in a remarkable way during the run-up to opening night,” Shawn Robbins, director of movie analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory, told CNN in an email.
- Industry analysts initially projected Warner Bros. Pictures’ “A Minecraft Movie” would gross $60 million before adjusting that estimate to about $100 million. Warner Brothers Discovery is the parent company of CNN. On Sunday, Comscore estimated the movie grossed about $157 million domestically. “This is the first major over-performance,” Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore, told CNN.

### Summary
"A Minecraft Movie" has made a remarkable debut, grossing approximately $162.75 million domestically during its opening weekend, surpassing initial projections of $60 million and later estimates of $100 million. This performance not only marks the biggest opening weekend of 2025 but also positions it as the highest-grossing film based on a video game to date. While it's too early to definitively say if it will remain the top grossing movie of the year, its strong start and the current trend of video game adaptations suggest it has a solid chance. The film's success comes at a time when overall box office earnings are down, providing a much-needed boost to the industry.

—

The blockbuster adaption of the 2011 video game “Minecraft” shattered box office expectations, grossing $162.75 million domestically, and marking the biggest opening weekend of the year.

Industry analysts initially projected Warner Bros. Pictures’ “A Minecraft Movie” would gross $60 million before adjusting that estimate to about $100 million. Warner Brothers Discovery is the parent company of CNN. On Sunday, Comscore estimated the movie grossed about $157 million domestically.

“This is the first major over-performance,” Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore, told CNN. “A Minecraft Movie” surged past the opening weekend of Disney’s “Captain America: Brave New World,” which had been the top opener of 2025 with an opening weekend

### Summary
**Summary:** The *A Minecraft Movie*, which was initially projected to gross around $65 million in its opening weekend, unexpectedly topped $160 million, marking the biggest debut of 2025 so far. This performance has delighted theater operators amid a struggling film industry. While it's too early to definitively say it will be the top-grossing movie of the year, its strong opening suggests it could be a contender, especially given the trend of recent blockbusters exceeding expectations. Other films like *Moana 2* and *Inside Out 2* have also significantly outperformed forecasts in recent years.

### Key Highlights
- Five things you need to know The massive blockbuster that no one predicted Less than a week before the release of A Minecraft Movie, experts projected the film would gross about $65 million over its opening weekend. As more data trickled in, some increased their forecasts to $85 million or even $100 million. Nobody anticipated it would top $160 million in the US and Canada, the biggest debut of the year.
- The performance delighted theater operators, which are looking for any good news for the struggling film business. But its success also prompted a follow-up question. How did everyone get it so wrong? A Minecraft Movie is just the latest blockbuster that forecasters missed by a huge margin. Just last year, Moana 2, It Ends With Us, Twisters and Inside Out 2 all exceeded expectations by quite a bit, as did The Super Mario Bros. Movie and Barbie in 2023 and Minions: The Rise of Gru in 2022.
- People talked about it at the office or at a bar. Much of that conversation now happens online – at least among the young. A Minecraft Movie was most popular with men under the age of 25. The movie grossed $11 million in previews Thursday night – a good number, but not one that normally would have led to a $160 million weekend. Fueled by TikTok memes and activations within the video game, interest in the film ballooned over the weekend.

Good evening from New York, and congratulations on surviving another roller-coaster week. The current stock market volatility is going to cost the media business $45 billion in advertising sales in the US, according to a report from MoffettNathanson. Internet companies like Alphabet and Meta will lose the most because they make the most. Meta, Snap, Alphabet and Roku all make the majority of their money from ads. But this could become an inflection point for the TV advertising business – and not a good one. “We worry that television could mirror the fate of radio and newspapers during past recessions,” the research firm wrote. We covered the potential impact of tariffs and a recession last week.

### Summary
"A Minecraft Movie" has made a significant impact at the box office since its release, achieving record-breaking numbers in Australia and globally. With a debut of $13.7 million in Australia and $301 million worldwide, it currently holds the title of the highest-grossing video game adaptation in Australia, surpassing "The Super Mario Bros." This strong performance, particularly among the Gen Z demographic, suggests that the film has the potential to remain a top contender throughout 2025. However, upcoming blockbusters like "Mission Impossible 8" and "How To Train Your Dragon" may challenge its position as the top-grossing movie of the year. The excitement surrounding "A Minecraft Movie" indicates it will continue to resonate with audiences, but its ultimate ranking will depend on the performance of these future releases.

### Key Highlights
- At the box office, the film earned $13.7 million, marking the biggest opening for a film since “Deadpool & Wolverine,” which was released in July last year. This record-breaking debut crowned “A Minecraft Movie” as the highest-grossing opening for a video game film in Australia overtaking “The Super Mario Bros.” and also cemented its place as the third-biggest PG film opening in history, behind only “Barbie” and “The Lion King.”
- After breaking new ground in gaming over a decade ago, “A Minecraft Movie” – the film adaptation of one of the best-selling video games – has built itself into a global box office sensation since releasing in cinemas across the world last week. In Australia, “A Minecraft Movie” delivered 710,000 admissions over its Thursday to Sunday opening weekend, demonstrating its broad appeal across both families and Gen Z, with 33% of the first weekend’s audience coming from the hard-to-reach P14-24 demographic.
- “As one of the world’s most iconic video games, ‘A Minecraft Movie’ has delivered a record-breaking blockbuster opening, with strong momentum set to carry through the Easter school holidays, said Guy Burbidge, Managing Director of Val Morgan Cinema. “Minecraft is one of the few IPs that was born alongside Gen Z, it’s grown with them and is a staple of their generation, and this colossal opening is a clear reminder of the power and value Cinema has in reaching younger audiences.

“A Minecraft Movie’s” global opening also shattered records worldwide, grossing an impressive $301 million (USD).

“As one of the world’s most iconic video games, ‘A Minecraft Movie’ has delivered a record-breaking blockbuster opening, with strong momentum set to carry through the Easter school holidays, said Guy Burbidge, Managing Director of Val Morgan Cinema.

The film, produced by Warner Bros. and Legendary, is expected to add over $65 million internationally, bringing its global total to approximately $135 million to $150 million. While the film's production cost was $150 million, its appeal stems from the popularity of the Minecraft franchise and its multigenerational fanbase.

The film features a star-studded cast, including Jason Momoa, Jack Black, and Jennifer Coolidge, which may enhance its appeal.

This performance has delighted theater operators amid a struggling film industry. While it's too early to definitively say it will be the top-grossing movie of the year, its strong opening suggests it could be a contender, especially given the trend of recent blockbusters exceeding expectations. Other films like *Moana 2* and *Inside Out 2* have also significantly outperformed forecasts in recent years.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Five things you need to know The massive blockbuster that no one predicted Less than a week before the release of A Minecraft Movie, experts projected the film would gross about $65 million over its opening weekend. As more data trickled in, some increased their forecasts to $85 million or even $100 million. Nobody anticipated it would top $160 million in the US and Canada, the biggest debut of the year.\n- The performance delighted theater operators, which are looking for any good news for the struggling film business. But its success also prompted a follow-up question. How did everyone get it so wrong? A Minecraft Movie is just the latest blockbuster that forecasters missed by a huge margin. Just last year, Moana 2, It Ends With Us, Twisters and Inside Out 2 all exceeded expectations by quite a bit, as did The Super Mario Bros. Movie and Barbie in 2023 and Minions: The Rise of Gru in 2022.\n- People talked about it at the office or at a bar. Much of that conversation now happens online – at least among the young. A Minecraft Movie was most popular with men under the age of 25. The movie grossed $11 million in previews Thursday night – a good number, but not one that normally would have led to a $160 million weekend. Fueled by TikTok memes and activations within the video game, interest in the film ballooned over the weekend.\n\n### Content\nGood evening from New York, and congratulations on surviving another roller-coaster week. The current stock market volatility is going to cost the media business $45 billion in advertising sales in the US, according to a report from MoffettNathanson. Internet companies like Alphabet and Meta will lose the most because they make the most. Meta, Snap, Alphabet and Roku all make the majority of their money from ads. But this could become an inflection point for the TV advertising business – and not a good one. “We worry that television could mirror the fate of radio and newspapers during past recessions,” the research firm wrote. We covered the potential impact of tariffs and a recession last week.

According to CNN Business (April 6, 2025), the film opened with $162.75 million domestically, marking the biggest opening weekend of the year and surpassing Disney's 'Captain America: Brave New World' which opened at $88.5 million. This represents a massive over-performance against initial projections of $60-65 million.\\n\\n(2) The film's total gross trajectory is extremely strong. Box Office Mojo data shows worldwide gross of approximately $909.7 million ($408.7 million domestic, $501 million international), while Sportskeeda reports the film had already reached $816 million as of mid-April 2025. The film became the first Hollywood release of 2025 to cross the $500 million mark globally, demonstrating sustained audience interest beyond the opening weekend.\\n\\n(3) Historical context from Bloomberg (April 13, 2025) indicates that recent blockbusters including Moana 2, Inside Out 2, and The Super Mario Bros.

      "outcomeReasoning": "(1) A Minecraft Movie has demonstrated exceptional box office performance that positions it as the frontrunner for 2025's top-grossing film. According to CNN Business (April 6, 2025), the film opened with $162.75 million domestically, marking the biggest opening weekend of the year and surpassing Disney's 'Captain America: Brave New World' which opened at $88.5 million. This represents a massive over-performance against initial projections of $60-65 million.\n\n(2) The film's total gross trajectory is extremely strong. Box Office Mojo data shows worldwide gross of approximately $909.7 million ($408.7 million domestic, $501 million international), while Sportskeeda reports the film had already reached $816 million as of mid-April 2025. The film became the first Hollywood release of 2025 to cross the $500 million mark globally, demonstrating sustained audience interest beyond the opening weekend.\n\n(3) Historical context from Bloomberg (April 13, 2025) indicates that recent blockbusters including Moana 2, Inside Out 2, and The Super Mario Bros. Movie significantly exceeded forecasts, with Inside Out 2 opening $54 million above estimates. A Minecraft Movie follows this pattern of video game and family-friendly adaptations over-performing, suggesting strong legs throughout 2025.\n\n(4) The film's appeal to the critical Gen Z demographic (33% of opening weekend audience per Celluloid Junkie) and its viral social media presence on TikTok provide ongoing marketing momentum that should sustain box office performance through the year.

The film, produced by Warner Bros. and Legendary, is expected to add over $65 million internationally, bringing its global total to approximately $135 million to $150 million. While the film's production cost was $150 million, its appeal stems from the popularity of the Minecraft franchise and its multigenerational fanbase. Despite the challenges of adapting video games into films, \"A Minecraft Movie\" is anticipated to be a commercial success, but whether it will be the top-grossing movie of 2025 remains uncertain as it competes with other major releases throughout the year.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- [Warner Bros.](https://www.imdb.com/company/co0026840/) and Legendary’s cinematic take on the beloved video game is targeting $70 million to $80 million in its domestic opening weekend.

This performance has delighted theater operators amid a struggling film industry. While it's too early to definitively say it will be the top-grossing movie of the year, its strong opening suggests it could be a contender, especially given the trend of recent blockbusters exceeding expectations. Other films like *Moana 2* and *Inside Out 2* have also significantly outperformed forecasts in recent years.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Five things you need to know The massive blockbuster that no one predicted Less than a week before the release of A Minecraft Movie, experts projected the film would gross about $65 million over its opening weekend. As more data trickled in, some increased their forecasts to $85 million or even $100 million. Nobody anticipated it would top $160 million in the US and Canada, the biggest debut of the year.\n- The performance delighted theater operators, which are looking for any good news for the struggling film business. But its success also prompted a follow-up question. How did everyone get it so wrong? A Minecraft Movie is just the latest blockbuster that forecasters missed by a huge margin. Just last year, Moana 2, It Ends With Us, Twisters and Inside Out 2 all exceeded expectations by quite a bit, as did The Super Mario Bros. Movie and Barbie in 2023 and Minions: The Rise of Gru in 2022.\n- People talked about it at the office or at a bar. Much of that conversation now happens online – at least among the young. A Minecraft Movie was most popular with men under the age of 25. The movie grossed $11 million in previews Thursday night – a good number, but not one that normally would have led to a $160 million weekend. Fueled by TikTok memes and activations within the video game, interest in the film ballooned over the weekend.\n\n### Content\nGood evening from New York, and congratulations on surviving another roller-coaster week. The current stock market volatility is going to cost the media business $45 billion in advertising sales in the US, according to a report from MoffettNathanson. Internet companies like Alphabet and Meta will lose the most because they make the most. Meta, Snap, Alphabet and Roku all make the majority of their money from ads. But this could become an inflection point for the TV advertising business – and not a good one. “We worry that television could mirror the fate of radio and newspapers during past recessions,” the research firm wrote. We covered the potential impact of tariffs and a recession last week. This week, a top producer shared three immediate concerns while planning for future shoots: If you are already seeing the effects of the trade war, you can reach me at lshaw31@bloomberg.net or on signal at lucas_shaw.63.

According to CNN Business (April 6, 2025), the film opened with $162.75 million domestically, marking the biggest opening weekend of the year and surpassing Disney's 'Captain America: Brave New World' which opened at $88.5 million. This represents a massive over-performance against initial projections of $60-65 million.\\n\\n(2) The film's total gross trajectory is extremely strong. Box Office Mojo data shows worldwide gross of approximately $909.7 million ($408.7 million domestic, $501 million international), while Sportskeeda reports the film had already reached $816 million as of mid-April 2025. The film became the first Hollywood release of 2025 to cross the $500 million mark globally, demonstrating sustained audience interest beyond the opening weekend.\\n\\n(3) Historical context from Bloomberg (April 13, 2025) indicates that recent blockbusters including Moana 2, Inside Out 2, and The Super Mario Bros. Movie significantly exceeded forecasts, with Inside Out 2 opening $54 million above estimates. A Minecraft Movie follows this pattern of video game and family-friendly adaptations over-performing, suggesting strong legs throughout 2025.\\n\\n(4) The film's appeal to the critical Gen Z demographic (33% of opening weekend audience per Celluloid Junkie) and its viral social media presence on TikTok provide ongoing marketing momentum that should sustain box office performance through the year. The film has already surpassed its $150 million production budget by over 5.4 times according to multiple sources.\\n\\n(5) While competition exists from upcoming releases like Mission Impossible 8 and How To Train Your Dragon, A Minecraft Movie's early April release date provides a significant head start in accumulating total calendar year gross. The market resolution criteria specifically focuses on 2025 calendar year domestic gross, where the film currently leads by a substantial margin.\",\n    \"confidence\": 72,\n    \"confidenceReasoning\": \"(1) Data quality is high with multiple credible sources (CNN Business, Box Office Mojo, Bloomberg) providing consistent box office figures. The $162.75 million opening weekend is well-documented across sources, and the film's performance through mid-April shows strong sustainability with totals exceeding $800 million globally.\\n\\n(2) However, several uncertainties reduce absolute confidence:\\n• We are still relatively early in 2025 (April data available), with 8+ months remaining for competing releases\\n• Major tentpole releases scheduled for summer and holiday seasons could potentially challenge the lead\\n• The research doesn't provide comprehensive information about all major 2025 releases and their projected performance\\n\\n(3) The current market odds (35.2% YES, 64.8% NO) suggest significant skepticism, which may indicate insider knowledge or awareness of upcoming releases not fully captured in the research. This discrepancy between strong performance data and market sentiment warrants caution.\\n\\n(4) Positive factors supporting confidence:\\n• The film has already achieved historic milestones (highest-grossing video game adaptation opening in Australia, biggest 2025 opening)\\n• Strong international performance ($501 million) provides diversified revenue streams\\n• Family-friendly PG rating aligns with highest-grossing films historically\\n• Sustained viral marketing and cultural relevance beyond opening weekend\\n\\n(5) The 72% confidence reflects strong current evidence favoring YES while acknowledging meaningful uncertainty from unknown future competition and the long timeframe remaining in 2025.

The film, produced by Warner Bros. and Legendary, is expected to add over $65 million internationally, bringing its global total to approximately $135 million to $150 million. While the film's production cost was $150 million, its appeal stems from the popularity of the Minecraft franchise and its multigenerational fanbase. Despite the challenges of adapting video games into films, \"A Minecraft Movie\" is anticipated to be a commercial success, but whether it will be the top-grossing movie of 2025 remains uncertain as it competes with other major releases throughout the year.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- [Warner Bros.](https://www.imdb.com/company/co0026840/) and Legendary’s cinematic take on the beloved video game is targeting $70 million to $80 million in its domestic opening weekend. Based on surging advanced ticket sales, rivals and independent tracking services believe the final number could be closer to $90 million, while Warner Bros. is offering a softer $65 million figure. “ [A Minecraft Movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3566834/)” should add another $65 million-plus at the international box office for a grand total of $135 million to $150 million globally to start.\n- The film cost $150 million to produce and plenty more to market. Thanks to pent-up demand, multigenerational appeal and goodwill toward the choose-your-own-adventure property, however, “ [A Minecraft Movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3566834/)” looks like it’ll be a commercial winner for Warner Bros. and movie theaters. Although it’s based on one of the best-selling video games in history, that kind of association doesn’t always guarantee success in Hollywood.\n- (Just...

This performance marks it as the biggest opening weekend of 2025, outpacing Disney's \"Captain America: Brave New World,\" which previously held the record with $88.5 million. \n\nGiven its strong start and the growing popularity of video game adaptations, \"A Minecraft Movie\" has the potential to become the top-grossing film of the year.

This performance has delighted theater operators amid a struggling film industry. While it's too early to definitively say it will be the top-grossing movie of the year, its strong opening suggests it could be a contender, especially given the trend of recent blockbusters exceeding expectations. Other films like *Moana 2* and *Inside Out 2* have also significantly outperformed forecasts in recent years.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Five things you need to know The massive blockbuster that no one predicted Less than a week before the release of A Minecraft Movie, experts projected the film would gross about $65 million over its opening weekend. As more data trickled in, some increased their forecasts to $85 million or even $100 million. Nobody anticipated it would top $160 million in the US and Canada, the biggest debut of the year.\n- The performance delighted theater operators, which are looking for any good news for the struggling film business. But its success also prompted a follow-up question. How did everyone get it so wrong? A Minecraft Movie is just the latest blockbuster that forecasters missed by a huge margin. Just last year, Moana 2, It Ends With Us, Twisters and Inside Out 2 all exceeded expectations by quite a bit, as did The Super Mario Bros. Movie and Barbie in 2023 and Minions: The Rise of Gru in 2022.\n- People talked about it at the office or at a bar. Much of that conversation now happens online – at least among the young. A Minecraft Movie was most popular with men under the age of 25. The movie grossed $11 million in previews Thursday night – a good number, but not one that normally would have led to a $160 million weekend. Fueled by TikTok memes and activations within the video game, interest in the film ballooned over the weekend.\n\n### Content\nGood evening from New York, and congratulations on surviving another roller-coaster week. The current stock market volatility is going to cost the media business $45 billion in advertising sales in the US, according to a report from MoffettNathanson. Internet companies like Alphabet and Meta will lose the most because they make the most. Meta, Snap, Alphabet and Roku all make the majority of their money from ads. But this could become an inflection point for the TV advertising business – and not a good one. “We worry that television could mirror the fate of radio and newspapers during past recessions,” the research firm wrote. We covered the potential impact of tariffs and a recession last week. This week, a top producer shared three immediate concerns while planning for future shoots: If you are already seeing the effects of the trade war, you can reach me at lshaw31@bloomberg.net or on signal at lucas_shaw.63.
