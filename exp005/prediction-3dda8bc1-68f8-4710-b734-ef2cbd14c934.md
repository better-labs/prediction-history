## AI Prediction Overview

- **Market Prediction:** 7.50%
- **AI Prediction:** 92%
- **Confidence:** 75%
- **AI Prediction Delta:** 84.50%

### Key Factors
- Fed officials projecting only two rate cuts total for 2025, likely before October
- Economist consensus expecting rate cuts to resume in September 2025
- Fed's hawkish December 2024 stance signaling fewer cuts and cautious approach
- Stable economic conditions with 1.4% GDP growth and moderate 3.0% inflation
- Strong market consensus (92.5%) pricing in no change
- Fed's data-dependent approach requiring spacing between rate adjustments
- Tariff policy uncertainty potentially constraining Fed action
- Historical pattern of Fed maintaining rates after recent cuts to assess impact

### Outcome Reasoning
(1) Multiple Federal Reserve officials and economic projections strongly suggest a holding pattern through October 2025. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly explicitly projected only two interest rate cuts for all of 2025 (Source 1, Investing.com, October 7, 2025), which would likely occur earlier in the year rather than at the October meeting.

(2) The Reuters poll of 105 economists indicates the Fed is expected to resume cutting rates in September 2025 (Source 2, FX Street, October 6, 2025), with over 60% anticipating at least two cuts during the year. This timing suggests cuts would occur before October, leaving the October meeting as a likely hold.

(3) The Fed's cautious approach is evident in recent policy decisions. According to Source 6 (Chandler Asset, January 10, 2025), the December 2024 FOMC meeting showed a "finely balanced" decision to cut rates by 25 basis points, accompanied by a hawkish outlook signaling fewer rate cuts in 2025. This conservative stance suggests the Fed will space out any cuts significantly.

(4) Economic conditions support a holding pattern by October. Source 8 (Bremer Bank, July 11, 2025) notes the Fed has been in a holding pattern since December 2024, with GDP growth forecast at 1.4% for 2025 and inflation expectations at 3.0%. With the economy described as "healthy" with low unemployment and moderate inflation, there's limited pressure for rate changes at every meeting.

(5) The market pricing reflects this expectation. The current Polymarket odds show 92.5% probability of no change, indicating strong market consensus. While market sentiment isn't always accurate, this level of conviction combined with expert forecasts creates a compelling case for no change at the October meeting.

### Confidence Reasoning
(1) Data quality and recency are strong. Multiple sources from October 2025 provide current insights directly relevant to the prediction timeframe. The Fed official statements (Source 1) and economist surveys (Source 2) represent authoritative, recent data points that significantly inform this prediction.

(2) However, several factors introduce uncertainty:

• The October 2025 meeting is still months away, and economic conditions can shift rapidly
• Tariff policy uncertainty mentioned in Source 8 could materially impact inflation and Fed decision-making
• The Fed's data-dependent approach means unexpected economic developments could trigger policy changes

(3) Source reliability varies but is generally high. Direct Fed official statements (Daly's comments) and established economic surveys (Reuters poll of 105 economists) provide credible foundations. The CME FedWatch tool (Source 3) offers market-based probabilities but wasn't fully accessible in the research.

(4) The convergence of multiple independent sources pointing to the same conclusion strengthens confidence. When Fed officials, economist surveys, and market pricing all align toward a holding pattern, it reduces the likelihood of a surprise rate change.

(5) Key limitation: The research doesn't provide detailed economic data from the months immediately preceding October 2025 (August-September economic releases, inflation reports, employment data). These near-term indicators would be crucial for final confirmation but aren't available in current research. This gap prevents confidence from reaching 85%+.

She noted that consumer spending is slowing but not stopping, suggesting a gradual cooling of economic activity. Looking ahead, Daly projected two interest rate cuts in 2025, implying that there may not be any changes to interest rates following the October 2025 meeting. This aligns with her view that potential tariff impacts are manageable and unlikely to significantly increase consumer prices, alleviating some inflation concerns.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Investing.com -- Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly said Thursday that the U.S. is making progress toward price stability, while expressing confidence that inflation is on a sustainable path down to the Fed’s 2% target. During a Q&A session, Daly noted that consumers are slowing but not stopping their spending, which suggests a gradual cooling in economic activity rather than a sharp decline.\n- When asked about tariffs, Daly indicated she would be concerned if tariff impacts spread beyond imports to other sectors of the economy. She observed that importers and retailers are currently absorbing some of the tariff costs rather than passing them fully to consumers. **The best opportunities often hide in plain sight—** buried among thousands of stocks you'd never have time to research individually.\n- That's why smart investors use our Stock Screener with 50+ predefined screens and 160+ customizable filters to surface hidden gems instantly.

The US economy is projected to grow by 1.4% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026. As of now, there is no immediate reaction from the US Dollar Index, which remains stable at 99.00. \n\nIn response to your query, while the Fed is expected to cut rates in the near future, there is no indication of a change in interest rates following the October 2025 meeting based on current forecasts.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- 59 of 105 economists polled by Reuters said that they expect the [Federal Reserve](https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/fed) (Fed) to resume cutting interest rates in the next quarter, likely in September. Monetary policy in the US is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these goals is by adjusting interest rates.\n- When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed’s 2% target, it raises interest rates, increasing borrowing costs throughout the economy. This results in a stronger US Dollar (USD) as it makes the US a more attractive place for international investors to park their money. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates to encourage borrowing, which weighs on the Greenback.\n- The Federal Reserve (Fed) holds eight policy meetings a year, where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) assesses economic conditions and makes monetary policy decisions. The FOMC is attended by twelve Fed officials – the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four of the remaining eleven regional Reserve Bank presidents, who serve one-year terms on a rotating basis.\n\n### Content\nTRENDING:\n\n[EUR/USD](https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/eurusd) [GBP/USD](https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/gbpusd) [XAU/USD](https://www.fxstreet.com/markets/commodities/metals/gold) [Trade War](https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/events/trade-war) [USD/CAD](https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/usdcad) [AUD/USD](https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/audusd)\n\n[Newsletter](https://www.fxstreet.com/subscriptions)\n\n[Upgrade](https://www.fxstreet.com/info/premium) [Login](https://www.fxstreet.com/account/login?uriToRedirect=https%3A%2F%2Fnull%2F&step=login-options)\n\n59 of 105 economists polled by Reuters said that they expect the [Federal Reserve](https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/fed) (Fed) to resume cutting interest rates in the next quarter, likely in September.\n\nMore than 60% of polled economists also said that they see the Fed lowering the policy rate at least twice this year.\n\nAccording to the findings, the US economy is [forecast](https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/forecast) to expand by 1.4% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026.\n\n## Market reaction\n\nThe US Dollar (USD) Index showed no immediate reaction to this headline and was last seen trading flat on the day at 99.00.\n\n## Fed FAQs\n\n### What does the Federal Reserve do, how does it impact the US Dollar?\n\nMonetary policy in the US is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed).

While it does not directly address interest rates or the October 2025 meeting, it highlights the Fed's intention to align its supervisory framework with the actual strength of banks and create consistency with other banking organizations. The proposed changes include allowing banks with one \"deficient-1\" rating to still be considered \"well managed,\" while those with any \"deficient-2\" ratings would not. The public can comment on the proposal for 30 days after its publication. For information on interest rates, further context from the Fed's monetary policy decisions would be needed.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Fed proposes changes to large bank supervisory rating framework Investing.com -- The Federal Reserve Board asked for public input on Thursday regarding changes to its supervisory rating system for large bank holding companies, specifically addressing their \"well managed\" status.  The proposed revisions aim to better align the supervisory framework with the actual strength of bank holding companies and the overall banking system.\n- The changes would also create more consistency with rating systems used for other banking organizations.  The Fed’s current large bank supervisory framework, established in 2018, evaluates banks on three components: capital, liquidity, and governance and controls. Each component can receive one of four ratings: broadly meets expectations, conditionally meets expectations, deficient-1, or deficient-2.\n- Under the new proposal, a bank with no more than one \"deficient-1\" rating would still be considered \"well managed.\" failing to meet this standard would be deemed not well managed and face restrictions on certain activities. Banks with any component rated as deficient-2 would continue to be classified as not well managed. The Fed plans to implement similar changes to its supervisory rating framework for insurers under its regulation.\n\n### Content\nFed proposes changes to large bank supervisory rating framework Investing.com -- The Federal Reserve Board asked for public input on Thursday regarding changes to its supervisory rating system for large bank holding companies, specifically addressing their \"well managed\" status. \n The proposed revisions aim to better align the supervisory framework with the actual strength of bank holding companies and the overall banking system.

Outlook\nURL: https://www.chandlerasset.com/insights/1/10/25weekly-economic-highlights-1\nPublished: 2025-10-01T00:00:00.000Z\n\n### Summary\nThe webpage discusses the current state of the U.S. labor market and its implications for the economy and Federal Reserve policy as of January 10, 2025. It highlights a strong December jobs report with a 256,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls and a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.1%. Wage growth is also noted, which presents challenges for the Fed in managing inflation and economic growth.\n\nThe minutes from the December Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting indicate that the decision to cut rates by 25 basis points was closely contested, with a hawkish outlook suggesting fewer rate cuts in 2025. This context implies that the Fed may not change interest rates significantly after the October 2025 meeting, especially given rising long-term inflation expectations.\n\nOverall, while the labor market remains resilient, mixed economic indicators and inflation concerns suggest that the Fed will proceed cautiously with future rate adjustments.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- This robust labor market underscores the Federal Reserve’s challenge of managing economic growth and inflationary risks. Minutes from the December Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting showed the decision to cut rates by 25 basis points was finely balanced, accompanied by a hawkish outlook signaling fewer rate cuts in 2025. The University of Michigan’s preliminary January survey added to inflation concerns, with long-term expectations rising to 3.3%, the highest since 2008, partly due to tariff worries under the incoming Trump administration.\n- The S&P 500 fell about 1.0%, erasing its 2025 gains, while Treasury yields climbed; the 2-year rose 10 basis points to 4.38%, the 5-year added 17 basis points to 4.58%, and the 10-year gained 16 basis points to 4.76%. The 30-year yield surpassed 5% for the first time since October 2023. The dollar strengthened as traders reduced expectations for further rate cuts, while commodities saw mixed results.\n- Market participants focused on better-than-expected labor market data this week, highlighting the resilience of the U.S. economy. The December jobs report revealed a 256,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls and a decline in the unemployment rate to 4.1%. Wage growth rose 0.3% month-over-month and 3.9% year-over-year, with gains in health care, retail, and leisure sectors, while manufacturing shed jobs.\n\n### Content\n# 1/10/25: Resilient U.S. Labor Market Drives Economic Outlook\n\nJan 10, 2025 \\|\n[Weekly Highlights](https://www.chandlerasset.com/insights/tag/weekly-highlights)\n\nMarket participants focused on better-than-expected labor market data this week, highlighting the resilience of the U.S. economy.

The Services and Composite PMIs remained above 50 but fell slightly below expectations. Factory orders declined, led by defense and ships/boats categories, with durable goods orders falling 1.2%. While manufacturing showed weakness, the strength of the service sector points to resilience in the broader economy.\n\nMarkets reflected these developments.

The Fed's decision to keep rates unchanged follows a quarter-point reduction in December 2024, as it balances economic growth with inflation concerns. The latest projections indicate a GDP growth forecast of 1.4% for 2025, slightly down from previous estimates, while inflation expectations have risen to 3.0%. This suggests that the Fed is likely to remain cautious in its monetary policy, potentially leading to no changes in interest rates after the October 2025 meeting.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- The Fed has been in a holding pattern as it awaits clarity around trade and tax policies. The Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) has kept interest rates unchanged since implementing a quarter-point reduction last December, reflecting a cautious approach to balancing economic growth against inflation. The Fed’s June meeting provided additional insight through its latest Summary of Economic Projections, a report released by the Fed four times a year with forecasts from the members of the FOMC.\n- The Fed typically lowers rates to stimulate growth during slow periods and raises them to cool the economy down when it shows signs of overheating. With a stronger economy, many economists and investors expect the Fed to cut rates in the second half of the year. Current market-based measures suggest two to three rate reductions for the second half of 2025, although this is always subject to change.\n- ### As we begin the second half of 2025, the U.S. economy presents a positive but mixed picture. The economy is healthy, unemployment remains low, inflation is moderate and consumer confidence is improving. However, government policies are changing rapidly, even if they are more certain than earlier this year. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve has kept policy rates on hold as it balances economic growth against inflation.\n\n### Content\n[Return to Insights](https://www.bremer.com/insights/wealth)\n\n## Economic challenges, opportunities on the horizon in the second half of 2025\n\n07.11.25\n\n_by Clearnomics_\n\n### As we begin the second half of 2025, the U.S. economy presents a positive but mixed picture. The economy is healthy, unemployment remains low, inflation is moderate and consumer confidence is improving. However, government policies are changing rapidly, even if they are more certain than earlier this year.\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve has kept policy rates on hold as it balances economic growth against inflation. Throughout all this, financial markets are adjusting their expectations as uncertainty continues around trade policy, as well as how tariffs might affect consumers and businesses.\n\nIn this environment, it’s important to stay informed on economic, political and financial market trends. Here are a few key themes that drove the economy in the first part of the year that will likely continue through the second half.\n\n### Tariff uncertainty is fading\n\nTrade policy was the main driver of market and economic uncertainty during the first six months of the year. As negotiations with trading partners have progressed, markets have rebounded to new all-time highs. The economic impact of tariffs is still uncertain, but many forward-looking expectations have improved.\n\nSeveral sectors that had previously underperformed — including industrials, communications and financials — gained momentum, which was another factor in surging market performance. Meanwhile, technology stocks continued their strong showing but were no longer the top market drivers that they were in 2023 and 2024.\n\n### Tax policy clarity is positive for households and businesses\n\n###### Individual and corporate taxes [1](https://www.bremer.com/www.bremer.com\\#6uhXDOvlHw4hsCS9iM6t3N)\n\nA new tax and spending bill was signed into law on July 4. Tax and spending policies have been a source of political uncertainty in recent years, but \n\n---\n\n# Task\n\nPlease analyze this market using ALL the information above (both market details and web research) and provide a structured prediction following this EXACT JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"marketId\": \"553812\",\n  \"question\": \"No change in Fed interest rates after October 2025 meeting?\",\n  \"prediction\": {\n    \"outcome\": \"YES\" | \"NO\" | \"UNCERTAIN\",\n    \"outcomeReasoning\": \"<Use clear structure with numbered points (1), (2), etc. Include paragraph breaks for readability.

(e.g. if there's a cut/increase of 12.5 bps it will be considered to be 25 bps)\n\nThe resolution source for this market is the FOMC’s statement after its meeting scheduled for October 28 - 29, 2025 according to the official calendar: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\nThe level and change of the target federal funds rate is also published at the official website of the Federal Reserve at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm.\n\nThis market may resolve as soon as the FOMC’s statement for their October meeting with relevant data is issued. If no statement is released by the end date of the next scheduled meeting, this market will resolve to the \"No change\" bracket.\n\n## Market Details\n- Market ID: 553812\n- Condition ID: 0x6ef34d5c7937cb8a1eb22234ddce8fe3eb1595e1f35c7d4f2101c58f3506e580\n- Active: Yes\n- Closed: No\n- Current Volume: 6413823.678806\n- Current Liquidity: 463160.1586\n- Current Outcome Prices: YES: 7.5%, NO: 92.5%\n\n---\n\n# Web Research Data\n\nThe following information was gathered from web research to provide context for this prediction:\n\n## Source 1: Fed’s Daly sees progress on inflation, expects two rate cuts in 2025 By Investing.com\nURL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/feds-daly-sees-progress-on-inflation-expects-two-rate-cuts-in-2025-93CH-4130796\nPublished: 2025-10-07T00:00:00.000Z\n\n### Summary\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly indicated that the U.S. is making progress toward achieving price stability, with inflation expected to trend down to the Fed's 2% target. She noted that consumer spending is slowing but not stopping, suggesting a gradual cooling of economic activity. Looking ahead, Daly projected two interest rate cuts in 2025, implying that there may not be any changes to interest rates following the October 2025 meeting. This aligns with her view that potential tariff impacts are manageable and unlikely to significantly increase consumer prices, alleviating some inflation concerns.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Investing.com -- Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly said Thursday that the U.S. is making progress toward price stability, while expressing confidence that inflation is on a sustainable path down to the Fed’s 2% target. During a Q&A session, Daly noted that consumers are slowing but not stopping their spending, which suggests a gradual cooling in economic activity rather than a sharp decline.\n- When asked about tariffs, Daly indicated she would be concerned if tariff impacts spread beyond imports to other sectors of the economy. She observed that importers and retailers are currently absorbing some of the tariff costs rather than passing them fully to consumers. **The best opportunities often hide in plain sight—** buried among thousands of stocks you'd never have time to research individually.\n- That's why smart investors use our Stock Screener with 50+ predefined screens and 160+ customizable filters to surface hidden gems instantly.

The US economy is projected to grow by 1.4% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026. As of now, there is no immediate reaction from the US Dollar Index, which remains stable at 99.00. \n\nIn response to your query, while the Fed is expected to cut rates in the near future, there is no indication of a change in interest rates following the October 2025 meeting based on current forecasts.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- 59 of 105 economists polled by Reuters said that they expect the [Federal Reserve](https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/fed) (Fed) to resume cutting interest rates in the next quarter, likely in September. Monetary policy in the US is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these goals is by adjusting interest rates.\n- When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed’s 2% target, it raises interest rates, increasing borrowing costs throughout the economy. This results in a stronger US Dollar (USD) as it makes the US a more attractive place for international investors to park their money. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates to encourage borrowing, which weighs on the Greenback.\n- The Federal Reserve (Fed) holds eight policy meetings a year, where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) assesses economic conditions and makes monetary policy decisions. The FOMC is attended by twelve Fed officials – the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four of the remaining eleven regional Reserve Bank presidents, who serve one-year terms on a rotating basis.\n\n### Content\nTRENDING:\n\n[EUR/USD](https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/eurusd) [GBP/USD](https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/gbpusd) [XAU/USD](https://www.fxstreet.com/markets/commodities/metals/gold) [Trade War](https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/events/trade-war) [USD/CAD](https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/usdcad) [AUD/USD](https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/audusd)\n\n[Newsletter](https://www.fxstreet.com/subscriptions)\n\n[Upgrade](https://www.fxstreet.com/info/premium) [Login](https://www.fxstreet.com/account/login?uriToRedirect=https%3A%2F%2Fnull%2F&step=login-options)\n\n59 of 105 economists polled by Reuters said that they expect the [Federal Reserve](https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/fed) (Fed) to resume cutting interest rates in the next quarter, likely in September.\n\nMore than 60% of polled economists also said that they see the Fed lowering the policy rate at least twice this year.\n\nAccording to the findings, the US economy is [forecast](https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/forecast) to expand by 1.4% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026.\n\n## Market reaction\n\nThe US Dollar (USD) Index showed no immediate reaction to this headline and was last seen trading flat on the day at 99.00.\n\n## Fed FAQs\n\n### What does the Federal Reserve do, how does it impact the US Dollar?\n\nMonetary policy in the US is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed).

While it does not directly address interest rates or the October 2025 meeting, it highlights the Fed's intention to align its supervisory framework with the actual strength of banks and create consistency with other banking organizations. The proposed changes include allowing banks with one \"deficient-1\" rating to still be considered \"well managed,\" while those with any \"deficient-2\" ratings would not. The public can comment on the proposal for 30 days after its publication. For information on interest rates, further context from the Fed's monetary policy decisions would be needed.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Fed proposes changes to large bank supervisory rating framework Investing.com -- The Federal Reserve Board asked for public input on Thursday regarding changes to its supervisory rating system for large bank holding companies, specifically addressing their \"well managed\" status.  The proposed revisions aim to better align the supervisory framework with the actual strength of bank holding companies and the overall banking system.\n- The changes would also create more consistency with rating systems used for other banking organizations.  The Fed’s current large bank supervisory framework, established in 2018, evaluates banks on three components: capital, liquidity, and governance and controls. Each component can receive one of four ratings: broadly meets expectations, conditionally meets expectations, deficient-1, or deficient-2.\n- Under the new proposal, a bank with no more than one \"deficient-1\" rating would still be considered \"well managed.\" failing to meet this standard would be deemed not well managed and face restrictions on certain activities. Banks with any component rated as deficient-2 would continue to be classified as not well managed. The Fed plans to implement similar changes to its supervisory rating framework for insurers under its regulation.\n\n### Content\nFed proposes changes to large bank supervisory rating framework Investing.com -- The Federal Reserve Board asked for public input on Thursday regarding changes to its supervisory rating system for large bank holding companies, specifically addressing their \"well managed\" status. \n The proposed revisions aim to better align the supervisory framework with the actual strength of bank holding companies and the overall banking system.

market and its implications for the economy and Federal Reserve policy as of January 10, 2025. It highlights a strong December jobs report with a 256,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls and a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.1%. Wage growth is also noted, which presents challenges for the Fed in managing inflation and economic growth.\n\nThe minutes from the December Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting indicate that the decision to cut rates by 25 basis points was closely contested, with a hawkish outlook suggesting fewer rate cuts in 2025. This context implies that the Fed may not change interest rates significantly after the October 2025 meeting, especially given rising long-term inflation expectations.\n\nOverall, while the labor market remains resilient, mixed economic indicators and inflation concerns suggest that the Fed will proceed cautiously with future rate adjustments.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- This robust labor market underscores the Federal Reserve’s challenge of managing economic growth and inflationary risks. Minutes from the December Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting showed the decision to cut rates by 25 basis points was finely balanced, accompanied by a hawkish outlook signaling fewer rate cuts in 2025. The University of Michigan’s preliminary January survey added to inflation concerns, with long-term expectations rising to 3.3%, the highest since 2008, partly due to tariff worries under the incoming Trump administration.\n- The S&P 500 fell about 1.0%, erasing its 2025 gains, while Treasury yields climbed; the 2-year rose 10 basis points to 4.38%, the 5-year added 17 basis points to 4.58%, and the 10-year gained 16 basis points to 4.76%. The 30-year yield surpassed 5% for the first time since October 2023. The dollar strengthened as traders reduced expectations for further rate cuts, while commodities saw mixed results.\n- Market participants focused on better-than-expected labor market data this week, highlighting the resilience of the U.S. economy. The December jobs report revealed a 256,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls and a decline in the unemployment rate to 4.1%. Wage growth rose 0.3% month-over-month and 3.9% year-over-year, with gains in health care, retail, and leisure sectors, while manufacturing shed jobs.\n\n### Content\n# 1/10/25: Resilient U.S. Labor Market Drives Economic Outlook\n\nJan 10, 2025 \\|\n[Weekly Highlights](https://www.chandlerasset.com/insights/tag/weekly-highlights)\n\nMarket participants focused on better-than-expected labor market data this week, highlighting the resilience of the U.S. economy.

The Services and Composite PMIs remained above 50 but fell slightly below expectations. Factory orders declined, led by defense and ships/boats categories, with durable goods orders falling 1.2%. While manufacturing showed weakness, the strength of the service sector points to resilience in the broader economy.\n\nMarkets reflected these developments. The S&P 500 fell about 1.0%, erasing its 2025 gains, while Treasury yields climbed; the 2-year rose 10 basis points to 4.38%, the 5-year added 17 basis points to 4.58%, and the 10-year gained 16 basis points to 4.76%. The 30-year yield surpassed 5% for the first time since October 2023. The dollar strengthened as traders reduced expectations for further rate cuts, while commodities saw mixed results.

The Fed's decision to keep rates unchanged follows a quarter-point reduction in December 2024, as it balances economic growth with inflation concerns. The latest projections indicate a GDP growth forecast of 1.4% for 2025, slightly down from previous estimates, while inflation expectations have risen to 3.0%. This suggests that the Fed is likely to remain cautious in its monetary policy, potentially leading to no changes in interest rates after the October 2025 meeting.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- The Fed has been in a holding pattern as it awaits clarity around trade and tax policies. The Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) has kept interest rates unchanged since implementing a quarter-point reduction last December, reflecting a cautious approach to balancing economic growth against inflation. The Fed’s June meeting provided additional insight through its latest Summary of Economic Projections, a report released by the Fed four times a year with forecasts from the members of the FOMC.\n- The Fed typically lowers rates to stimulate growth during slow periods and raises them to cool the economy down when it shows signs of overheating. With a stronger economy, many economists and investors expect the Fed to cut rates in the second half of the year. Current market-based measures suggest two to three rate reductions for the second half of 2025, although this is always subject to change.\n- ### As we begin the second half of 2025, the U.S. economy presents a positive but mixed picture. The economy is healthy, unemployment remains low, inflation is moderate and consumer confidence is improving. However, government policies are changing rapidly, even if they are more certain than earlier this year. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve has kept policy rates on hold as it balances economic growth against inflation.\n\n### Content\n[Return to Insights](https://www.bremer.com/insights/wealth)\n\n## Economic challenges, opportunities on the horizon in the second half of 2025\n\n07.11.25\n\n_by Clearnomics_\n\n### As we begin the second half of 2025, the U.S. economy presents a positive but mixed picture. The economy is healthy, unemployment remains low, inflation is moderate and consumer confidence is improving. However, government policies are changing rapidly, even if they are more certain than earlier this year.\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve has kept policy rates on hold as it balances economic growth against inflation. Throughout all this, financial markets are adjusting their expectations as uncertainty continues around trade policy, as well as how tariffs might affect consumers and businesses.\n\nIn this environment, it’s important to stay informed on economic, political and financial market trends. Here are a few key themes that drove the economy in the first part of the year that will likely continue through the second half.\n\n### Tariff uncertainty is fading\n\nTrade policy was the main driver of market and economic uncertainty during the first six months of the year. As negotiations with trading partners have progressed, markets have rebounded to new all-time highs. The economic impact of tariffs is still uncertain, but many forward-looking expectations have improved.\n\nSeveral sectors that had previously underperformed — including industrials, communications and financials — gained momentum, which was another factor in surging market performance. Meanwhile, technology stocks continued their strong showing but were no longer the top market drivers that they were in 2023 and 2024.\n\n### Tax policy clarity is positive for households and businesses\n\n###### Individual and corporate taxes [1](https://www.bremer.com/www.bremer.com\\#6uhXDOvlHw4hsCS9iM6t3N)\n\nA new tax and spending bill was signed into law on July 4. Tax and spending policies have been a source of political uncertainty in recent years, but \n\n---\n\n# Task\n\nPlease analyze this market using ALL the information above (both market details and web research) and provide a structured prediction following this EXACT JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"marketId\": \"553812\",\n  \"question\": \"No change in Fed interest rates after October 2025 meeting?\",\n  \"prediction\": {\n    \"outcome\": \"YES\" | \"NO\" | \"UNCERTAIN\",\n    \"outcomeReasoning\": \"<Use clear structure with numbered points (1), (2), etc. Include paragraph breaks for readability.

San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly explicitly projected only two interest rate cuts for all of 2025 (Source 1, Investing.com, October 7, 2025), which would likely occur earlier in the year rather than at the October meeting.\\n\\n(2) The Reuters poll of 105 economists indicates the Fed is expected to resume cutting rates in September 2025 (Source 2, FX Street, October 6, 2025), with over 60% anticipating at least two cuts during the year. This timing suggests cuts would occur before October, leaving the October meeting as a likely hold.\\n\\n(3) The Fed's cautious approach is evident in recent policy decisions. According to Source 6 (Chandler Asset, January 10, 2025), the December 2024 FOMC meeting showed a \\\"finely balanced\\\" decision to cut rates by 25 basis points, accompanied by a hawkish outlook signaling fewer rate cuts in 2025. This conservative stance suggests the Fed will space out any cuts significantly.\\n\\n(4) Economic conditions support a holding pattern by October. Source 8 (Bremer Bank, July 11, 2025) notes the Fed has been in a holding pattern since December 2024, with GDP growth forecast at 1.4% for 2025 and inflation expectations at 3.0%. With the economy described as \\\"healthy\\\" with low unemployment and moderate inflation, there's limited pressure for rate changes at every meeting.\\n\\n(5) The market pricing reflects this expectation. The current Polymarket odds show 92.5% probability of no change, indicating strong market consensus. While market sentiment isn't always accurate, this level of conviction combined with expert forecasts creates a compelling case for no change at the October meeting.\",\n    \"confidence\": 75,\n    \"confidenceReasoning\": \"(1) Data quality and recency are strong. Multiple sources from October 2025 provide current insights directly relevant to the prediction timeframe. The Fed official statements (Source 1) and economist surveys (Source 2) represent authoritative, recent data points that significantly inform this prediction.\\n\\n(2) However, several factors introduce uncertainty:\\n\\n• The October 2025 meeting is still months away, and economic conditions can shift rapidly\\n• Tariff policy uncertainty mentioned in Source 8 could materially impact inflation and Fed decision-making\\n• The Fed's data-dependent approach means unexpected economic developments could trigger policy changes\\n\\n(3) Source reliability varies but is generally high. Direct Fed official statements (Daly's comments) and established economic surveys (Reuters poll of 105 economists) provide credible foundations. The CME FedWatch tool (Source 3) offers market-based probabilities but wasn't fully accessible in the research.\\n\\n(4) The convergence of multiple independent sources pointing to the same conclusion strengthens confidence. When Fed officials, economist surveys, and market pricing all align toward a holding pattern, it reduces the likelihood of a surprise rate change.\\n\\n(5) Key limitation: The research doesn't provide detailed economic data from the months immediately preceding October 2025 (August-September economic releases, inflation reports, employment data). These near-term indicators would be crucial for final confirmation but aren't available in current research. This gap prevents confidence from reaching 85%+.\",\n    \"probability\": 92\n  },\n  \"keyFactors\": [\n    \"Fed officials projecting only two rate cuts total for 2025, likely before October\",\n    \"Economist consensus expecting rate cuts to resume in September 2025\",\n    \"Fed's hawkish December 2024 stance signaling fewer cuts and cautious approach\",\n    \"Stable economic conditions with 1.4% GDP growth and moderate 3.0% inflation\",\n    \"Strong market consensus (92.5%) pricing in no change\",\n    \"Fed's data-dependent approach requiring spacing between rate adjustments\",\n    \"Tariff policy uncertainty potentially constraining Fed action\",\n    \"Historical pattern of Fed maintaining rates after recent cuts to assess impact\"\n  ],\n  \"dataQuality\": \"HIGH\",\n  \"lastUpdated\": \"2025-01-09T00:00:00Z\"\n}\n```",

She noted that consumer spending is slowing but not stopping, suggesting a gradual cooling of economic activity. Looking ahead, Daly projected two interest rate cuts in 2025, implying that there may not be any changes to interest rates following the October 2025 meeting. This aligns with her view that potential tariff impacts are manageable and unlikely to significantly increase consumer prices, alleviating some inflation concerns.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Investing.com -- Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly said Thursday that the U.S. is making progress toward price stability, while expressing confidence that inflation is on a sustainable path down to the Fed’s 2% target. During a Q&A session, Daly noted that consumers are slowing but not stopping their spending, which suggests a gradual cooling in economic activity rather than a sharp decline.\n- When asked about tariffs, Daly indicated she would be concerned if tariff impacts spread beyond imports to other sectors of the economy. She observed that importers and retailers are currently absorbing some of the tariff costs rather than passing them fully to consumers. **The best opportunities often hide in plain sight—** buried among thousands of stocks you'd never have time to research individually.\n- That's why smart investors use our Stock Screener with 50+ predefined screens and 160+ customizable filters to surface hidden gems instantly.

Its primary tool to achieve these goals is by adjusting interest rates.\n- When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed’s 2% target, it raises interest rates, increasing borrowing costs throughout the economy. This results in a stronger US Dollar (USD) as it makes the US a more attractive place for international investors to park their money. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates to encourage borrowing, which weighs on the Greenback.\n- The Federal Reserve (Fed) holds eight policy meetings a year, where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) assesses economic conditions and makes monetary policy decisions. The FOMC is attended by twelve Fed officials – the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four of the remaining eleven regional Reserve Bank presidents, who serve one-year terms on a rotating basis.\n\n### Content\nTRENDING:\n\n[EUR/USD](https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/eurusd) [GBP/USD](https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/gbpusd) [XAU/USD](https://www.fxstreet.com/markets/commodities/metals/gold) [Trade War](https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/events/trade-war) [USD/CAD](https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/usdcad) [AUD/USD](https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/audusd)\n\n[Newsletter](https://www.fxstreet.com/subscriptions)\n\n[Upgrade](https://www.fxstreet.com/info/premium) [Login](https://www.fxstreet.com/account/login?uriToRedirect=https%3A%2F%2Fnull%2F&step=login-options)\n\n59 of 105 economists polled by Reuters said that they expect the [Federal Reserve](https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/fed) (Fed) to resume cutting interest rates in the next quarter, likely in September.\n\nMore than 60% of polled economists also said that they see the Fed lowering the policy rate at least twice this year.\n\nAccording to the findings, the US economy is [forecast](https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/forecast) to expand by 1.4% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026.\n\n## Market reaction\n\nThe US Dollar (USD) Index showed no immediate reaction to this headline and was last seen trading flat on the day at 99.00.\n\n## Fed FAQs\n\n### What does the Federal Reserve do, how does it impact the US Dollar?\n\nMonetary policy in the US is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed).

While it does not directly address interest rates or the October 2025 meeting, it highlights the Fed's intention to align its supervisory framework with the actual strength of banks and create consistency with other banking organizations. The proposed changes include allowing banks with one \"deficient-1\" rating to still be considered \"well managed,\" while those with any \"deficient-2\" ratings would not. The public can comment on the proposal for 30 days after its publication. For information on interest rates, further context from the Fed's monetary policy decisions would be needed.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Fed proposes changes to large bank supervisory rating framework Investing.com -- The Federal Reserve Board asked for public input on Thursday regarding changes to its supervisory rating system for large bank holding companies, specifically addressing their \"well managed\" status.  The proposed revisions aim to better align the supervisory framework with the actual strength of bank holding companies and the overall banking system.\n- The changes would also create more consistency with rating systems used for other banking organizations.  The Fed’s current large bank supervisory framework, established in 2018, evaluates banks on three components: capital, liquidity, and governance and controls. Each component can receive one of four ratings: broadly meets expectations, conditionally meets expectations, deficient-1, or deficient-2.\n- Under the new proposal, a bank with no more than one \"deficient-1\" rating would still be considered \"well managed.\" failing to meet this standard would be deemed not well managed and face restrictions on certain activities. Banks with any component rated as deficient-2 would continue to be classified as not well managed. The Fed plans to implement similar changes to its supervisory rating framework for insurers under its regulation.\n\n### Content\nFed proposes changes to large bank supervisory rating framework Investing.com -- The Federal Reserve Board asked for public input on Thursday regarding changes to its supervisory rating system for large bank holding companies, specifically addressing their \"well managed\" status. \n The proposed revisions aim to better align the supervisory framework with the actual strength of bank holding companies and the overall banking system.

Outlook\nURL: https://www.chandlerasset.com/insights/1/10/25weekly-economic-highlights-1\nPublished: 2025-10-01T00:00:00.000Z\n\n### Summary\nThe webpage discusses the current state of the U.S. labor market and its implications for the economy and Federal Reserve policy as of January 10, 2025. It highlights a strong December jobs report with a 256,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls and a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.1%. Wage growth is also noted, which presents challenges for the Fed in managing inflation and economic growth.\n\nThe minutes from the December Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting indicate that the decision to cut rates by 25 basis points was closely contested, with a hawkish outlook suggesting fewer rate cuts in 2025. This context implies that the Fed may not change interest rates significantly after the October 2025 meeting, especially given rising long-term inflation expectations.\n\nOverall, while the labor market remains resilient, mixed economic indicators and inflation concerns suggest that the Fed will proceed cautiously with future rate adjustments.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- This robust labor market underscores the Federal Reserve’s challenge of managing economic growth and inflationary risks. Minutes from the December Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting showed the decision to cut rates by 25 basis points was finely balanced, accompanied by a hawkish outlook signaling fewer rate cuts in 2025. The University of Michigan’s preliminary January survey added to inflation concerns, with long-term expectations rising to 3.3%, the highest since 2008, partly due to tariff worries under the incoming Trump administration.\n- The S&P 500 fell about 1.0%, erasing its 2025 gains, while Treasury yields climbed; the 2-year rose 10 basis points to 4.38%, the 5-year added 17 basis points to 4.58%, and the 10-year gained 16 basis points to 4.76%. The 30-year yield surpassed 5% for the first time since October 2023. The dollar strengthened as traders reduced expectations for further rate cuts, while commodities saw mixed results.\n- Market participants focused on better-than-expected labor market data this week, highlighting the resilience of the U.S. economy. The December jobs report revealed a 256,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls and a decline in the unemployment rate to 4.1%. Wage growth rose 0.3% month-over-month and 3.9% year-over-year, with gains in health care, retail, and leisure sectors, while manufacturing shed jobs.\n\n### Content\n# 1/10/25: Resilient U.S. Labor Market Drives Economic Outlook\n\nJan 10, 2025 \\|\n[Weekly Highlights](https://www.chandlerasset.com/insights/tag/weekly-highlights)\n\nMarket participants focused on better-than-expected labor market data this week, highlighting the resilience of the U.S. economy.

The Services and Composite PMIs remained above 50 but fell slightly below expectations. Factory orders declined, led by defense and ships/boats categories, with durable goods orders falling 1.2%. While manufacturing showed weakness, the strength of the service sector points to resilience in the broader economy.\n\nMarkets reflected these developments. The S&P 500 fell about 1.0%, erasing its 2025 gains, while Treasury yields climbed; the 2-year rose 10 basis points to 4.38%, the 5-year added 17 basis points to 4.58%, and the 10-year gained 16 basis points to 4.76%.

The Fed's decision to keep rates unchanged follows a quarter-point reduction in December 2024, as it balances economic growth with inflation concerns. The latest projections indicate a GDP growth forecast of 1.4% for 2025, slightly down from previous estimates, while inflation expectations have risen to 3.0%. This suggests that the Fed is likely to remain cautious in its monetary policy, potentially leading to no changes in interest rates after the October 2025 meeting.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- The Fed has been in a holding pattern as it awaits clarity around trade and tax policies. The Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) has kept interest rates unchanged since implementing a quarter-point reduction last December, reflecting a cautious approach to balancing economic growth against inflation. The Fed’s June meeting provided additional insight through its latest Summary of Economic Projections, a report released by the Fed four times a year with forecasts from the members of the FOMC.\n- The Fed typically lowers rates to stimulate growth during slow periods and raises them to cool the economy down when it shows signs of overheating. With a stronger economy, many economists and investors expect the Fed to cut rates in the second half of the year. Current market-based measures suggest two to three rate reductions for the second half of 2025, although this is always subject to change.\n- ### As we begin the second half of 2025, the U.S. economy presents a positive but mixed picture. The economy is healthy, unemployment remains low, inflation is moderate and consumer confidence is improving. However, government policies are changing rapidly, even if they are more certain than earlier this year. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve has kept policy rates on hold as it balances economic growth against inflation.\n\n### Content\n[Return to Insights](https://www.bremer.com/insights/wealth)\n\n## Economic challenges, opportunities on the horizon in the second half of 2025\n\n07.11.25\n\n_by Clearnomics_\n\n### As we begin the second half of 2025, the U.S. economy presents a positive but mixed picture. The economy is healthy, unemployment remains low, inflation is moderate and consumer confidence is improving. However, government policies are changing rapidly, even if they are more certain than earlier this year.\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve has kept policy rates on hold as it balances economic growth against inflation. Throughout all this, financial markets are adjusting their expectations as uncertainty continues around trade policy, as well as how tariffs might affect consumers and businesses.\n\nIn this environment, it’s important to stay informed on economic, political and financial market trends. Here are a few key themes that drove the economy in the first part of the year that will likely continue through the second half.\n\n### Tariff uncertainty is fading\n\nTrade policy was the main driver of market and economic uncertainty during the first six months of the year. As negotiations with trading partners have progressed, markets have rebounded to new all-time highs. The economic impact of tariffs is still uncertain, but many forward-looking expectations have improved.\n\nSeveral sectors that had previously underperformed — including industrials, communications and financials — gained momentum, which was another factor in surging market performance. Meanwhile, technology stocks continued their strong showing but were no longer the top market drivers that they were in 2023 and 2024.\n\n### Tax policy clarity is positive for households and businesses\n\n###### Individual and corporate taxes [1](https://www.bremer.com/www.bremer.com\\#6uhXDOvlHw4hsCS9iM6t3N)\n\nA new tax and spending bill was signed into law on July 4.

Published: 2025-10-07T00:00:00.000Z

### Summary
Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly indicated that the U.S. is making progress toward achieving price stability, with inflation expected to trend down to the Fed's 2% target. She noted that consumer spending is slowing but not stopping, suggesting a gradual cooling of economic activity. Looking ahead, Daly projected two interest rate cuts in 2025, implying that there may not be any changes to interest rates following the October 2025 meeting. This aligns with her view that potential tariff impacts are manageable and unlikely to significantly increase consumer prices, alleviating some inflation concerns.

### Key Highlights
- Investing.com -- Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly said Thursday that the U.S. is making progress toward price stability, while expressing confidence that inflation is on a sustainable path down to the Fed’s 2% target. During a Q&A session, Daly noted that consumers are slowing but not stopping their spending, which suggests a gradual cooling in economic activity rather than a sharp decline.
- When asked about tariffs, Daly indicated she would be concerned if tariff impacts spread beyond imports to other sectors of the economy. She observed that importers and retailers are currently absorbing some of the tariff costs rather than passing them fully to consumers. **The best opportunities often hide in plain sight—** buried among thousands of stocks you'd never have time to research individually.

## Source 2: Reuters poll: Fed likely to resume cutting rates in September
URL: https://www.fxstreet.com/news/reuters-poll-fed-likely-to-resume-cutting-rates-in-september-202506101215
Published: 2025-10-06T00:00:00.000Z

### Summary
The Reuters poll indicates that 59 out of 105 economists expect the Federal Reserve (Fed) to resume cutting interest rates in September 2025, with over 60% anticipating at least two rate cuts within that year. The US economy is projected to grow by 1.4% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026. As of now, there is no immediate reaction from the US Dollar Index, which remains stable at 99.00. 

In response to your query, while the Fed is expected to cut rates in the near future, there is no indication of a change in interest rates following the October 2025 meeting based on current forecasts.

### Key Highlights
- 59 of 105 economists polled by Reuters said that they expect the [Federal Reserve](https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/fed) (Fed) to resume cutting interest rates in the next quarter, likely in September. Monetary policy in the US is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these goals is by adjusting interest rates.
- When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed’s 2% target, it raises interest rates, increasing borrowing costs throughout the economy. This results in a stronger US Dollar (USD) as it makes the US a more attractive place for international investors to park their money. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates to encourage borrowing, which weighs on the Greenback.
- The Federal Reserve (Fed) holds eight policy meetings a year, where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) assesses economic conditions and makes monetary policy decisions. The FOMC is attended by twelve Fed officials – the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four of the remaining eleven regional Reserve Bank presidents, who serve one-year terms on a rotating basis.

## Source 4: Fed proposes changes to large bank supervisory rating framework By Investing.com
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/fed-proposes-changes-to-large-bank-supervisory-rating-framework-93CH-4130787
Published: 2025-10-07T00:00:00.000Z

### Summary
The article discusses the Federal Reserve's proposal to revise its supervisory rating framework for large bank holding companies, focusing on their "well managed" status. While it does not directly address interest rates or the October 2025 meeting, it highlights the Fed's intention to align its supervisory framework with the actual strength of banks and create consistency with other banking organizations. The proposed changes include allowing banks with one "deficient-1" rating to still be considered "well managed," while those with any "deficient-2" ratings would not. The public can comment on the proposal for 30 days after its publication. For information on interest rates, further context from the Fed's monetary policy decisions would be needed.

### Key Highlights
- Fed proposes changes to large bank supervisory rating framework Investing.com -- The Federal Reserve Board asked for public input on Thursday regarding changes to its supervisory rating system for large bank holding companies, specifically addressing their "well managed" status.  The proposed revisions aim to better align the supervisory framework with the actual strength of bank holding companies and the overall banking system.
- The changes would also create more consistency with rating systems used for other banking organizations.  The Fed’s current large bank supervisory framework, established in 2018, evaluates banks on three components: capital, liquidity, and governance and controls. Each component can receive one of four ratings: broadly meets expectations, conditionally meets expectations, deficient-1, or deficient-2.
- Under the new proposal, a bank with no more than one "deficient-1" rating would still be considered "well managed." failing to meet this standard would be deemed not well managed and face restrictions on certain activities. Banks with any component rated as deficient-2 would continue to be classified as not well managed. The Fed plans to implement similar changes to its supervisory rating framework for insurers under its regulation.

## Source 6: 1/10/25: Resilient U.S. Labor Market Drives Economic Outlook
URL: https://www.chandlerasset.com/insights/1/10/25weekly-economic-highlights-1
Published: 2025-10-01T00:00:00.000Z

### Summary
The webpage discusses the current state of the U.S. labor market and its implications for the economy and Federal Reserve policy as of January 10, 2025. It highlights a strong December jobs report with a 256,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls and a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.1%. Wage growth is also noted, which presents challenges for the Fed in managing inflation and economic growth.

The minutes from the December Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting indicate that the decision to cut rates by 25 basis points was closely contested, with a hawkish outlook suggesting fewer rate cuts in 2025. This context implies that the Fed may not change interest rates significantly after the October 2025 meeting, especially given rising long-term inflation expectations.

Overall, while the labor market remains resilient, mixed economic indicators and inflation concerns suggest that the Fed will proceed cautiously with future rate adjustments.

### Key Highlights
- This robust labor market underscores the Federal Reserve’s challenge of managing economic growth and inflationary risks. Minutes from the December Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting showed the decision to cut rates by 25 basis points was finely balanced, accompanied by a hawkish outlook signaling fewer rate cuts in 2025. The University of Michigan’s preliminary January survey added to inflation concerns, with long-term expectations rising to 3.3%, the highest since 2008, partly due to tariff worries under the incoming Trump administration.
- The S&P 500 fell about 1.0%, erasing its 2025 gains, while Treasury yields climbed; the 2-year rose 10 basis points to 4.38%, the 5-year added 17 basis points to 4.58%, and the 10-year gained 16 basis points to 4.76%. The 30-year yield surpassed 5% for the first time since October 2023. The dollar strengthened as traders reduced expectations for further rate cuts, while commodities saw mixed results.
- Market participants focused on better-than-expected labor market data this week, highlighting the resilience of the U.S. economy. The December jobs report revealed a 256,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls and a decline in the unemployment rate to 4.1%. Wage growth rose 0.3% month-over-month and 3.9% year-over-year, with gains in health care, retail, and leisure sectors, while manufacturing shed jobs.

Market participants focused on better-than-expected labor market data this week, highlighting the resilience of the U.S. economy. The December jobs report revealed a 256,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls and a decline in the unemployment rate to 4.1%. Wage growth rose 0.3% month-over-month and 3.9% year-over-year, with gains in health care, retail, and leisure sectors, while manufacturing shed jobs. This robust labor market underscores the Federal Reserve’s challenge of managing economic growth and inflationary risks.

Minutes from the December Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting showed the decision to cut rates by 25 basis points was finely balanced, accompanied by a hawkish outlook signaling fewer rate cuts in 2025. The University of Michigan’s preliminary January survey added to inflation concerns, with long-term expectations rising to 3.3%, the highest since 2008, partly due to tariff worries under the incoming Trump administration.

Economic indicators presented mixed signals. The Services and Composite PMIs remained above 50 but fell slightly below expectations. Factory orders declined, led by defense and ships/boats categories, with durable goods orders falling 1.2%. While manufacturing showed weakness, the strength of the service sector points to resilience in the broader economy.

Markets reflected these developments. The S&P 500 fell about 1.0%, erasing its 2025 gains, while Treasury yields climbed; the 2-year rose 10 basis points to 4.38%, the 5-year added 17 basis points to 4.58%, and the 10-year gained 16 basis points to 4.76%. The 30-year yield surpassed 5% for the first time since October 2023. The dollar strengthened as traders reduced expectations for further rate cuts, while commodities saw mixed results. Gold rose 0.9% to $2,690.69 an ounce, and Brent crude reached $80.54 in Lond

## Source 8: Economic challenges, opportunities on the horizon in the second half of 2025 | Wealth Insights | Bremer Bank
URL: https://www.bremer.com/insights/wealth/2025-07-11-economic-challenges-opportunities-on-the-horizon-in-the-second-half-of-2025
Published: 2025-11-07T00:00:00.000Z
Author: 07.11.25

### Summary
As of July 2025, the Federal Reserve has maintained its interest rates, reflecting a cautious approach amid ongoing economic adjustments. The Fed's decision to keep rates unchanged follows a quarter-point reduction in December 2024, as it balances economic growth with inflation concerns. The latest projections indicate a GDP growth forecast of 1.4% for 2025, slightly down from previous estimates, while inflation expectations have risen to 3.0%. This suggests that the Fed is likely to remain cautious in its monetary policy, potentially leading to no changes in interest rates after the October 2025 meeting.

### Key Highlights
- The Fed has been in a holding pattern as it awaits clarity around trade and tax policies. The Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) has kept interest rates unchanged since implementing a quarter-point reduction last December, reflecting a cautious approach to balancing economic growth against inflation. The Fed’s June meeting provided additional insight through its latest Summary of Economic Projections, a report released by the Fed four times a year with forecasts from the members of the FOMC.
- The Fed typically lowers rates to stimulate growth during slow periods and raises them to cool the economy down when it shows signs of overheating. With a stronger economy, many economists and investors expect the Fed to cut rates in the second half of the year. Current market-based measures suggest two to three rate reductions for the second half of 2025, although this is always subject to change.
- ### As we begin the second half of 2025, the U.S. economy presents a positive but mixed picture. The economy is healthy, unemployment remains low, inflation is moderate and consumer confidence is improving. However, government policies are changing rapidly, even if they are more certain than earlier this year. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve has kept policy rates on hold as it balances economic growth against inflation.

## Economic challenges, opportunities on the horizon in the second half of 2025

07.11.25

_by Clearnomics_

### As we begin the second half of 2025, the U.S. economy presents a positive but mixed picture. The economy is healthy, unemployment remains low, inflation is moderate and consumer confidence is improving. However, government policies are changing rapidly, even if they are more certain than earlier this year.

Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve has kept policy rates on hold as it balances economic growth against inflation. Throughout all this, financial markets are adjusting their expectations as uncertainty continues around trade policy, as well as how tariffs might affect consumers and businesses.

In this environment, it’s important to stay informed on economic, political and financial market trends. Here are a few key themes that drove the economy in the first part of the year that will likely continue through the second half.

### Tariff uncertainty is fading

Trade policy was the main driver of market and economic uncertainty during the first six months of the year. As negotiations with trading partners have progressed, markets have rebounded to new all-time highs. The economic impact of tariffs is still uncertain, but many forward-looking expectations have improved.

Several sectors that had previously underperformed — including industrials, communications and financials — gained momentum, which was another factor in surging market performance. Meanwhile, technology stocks continued their strong showing but were no longer the top market drivers that they were in 2023 and 2024.

### Tax policy clarity is positive for households and businesses
