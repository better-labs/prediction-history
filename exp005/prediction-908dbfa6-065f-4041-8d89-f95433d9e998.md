# Will Gavin Newsom win the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination?

## AI Prediction Overview

- **AI Prediction Delta:** +0.50%
- **Confidence:** 35%
- **Market Prediction:** [37.50%](https://polymarket.com/event/democratic-presidential-nominee-2028/will-gavin-newsom-win-the-2028-democratic-presidential-nomination-568)
- **AI Prediction:** 38%

### Key Factors
- Kamala Harris's decision to run and her strength as the most recent Democratic nominee
- Newsom's ability to overcome 'California liberal' perception in swing states
- Size and composition of the final Democratic primary field
- Economic conditions and political environment in 2027-2028
- Newsom's performance in early primary states (Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina)
- Success in building support among key Democratic constituencies (Black voters, young voters, progressives)
- Fundraising capacity and campaign infrastructure development
- Impact of continued Trump opposition positioning versus governing record in California
- Endorsements from party establishment and progressive leaders
- Performance in debates and campaign trail over the next 2-3 years

### Outcome Reasoning
(1) STRONG POSITIONING BUT NOT DOMINANT: Gavin Newsom has established himself as a frontrunner for the 2028 Democratic nomination, with current polling showing him at approximately 25% support among Democratic voters (Source 4: California Globe, Sept 2025) and Polymarket giving him 35% probability (Source 8). However, this falls short of a commanding lead that would suggest inevitability.

(2) SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM KAMALA HARRIS: The research reveals a critical challenge - Vice President Kamala Harris remains a formidable competitor. Post-2024 election polling from Emerson showed Harris at 37% compared to Newsom's 7% (Source 1: OC Register, Jan 2025). While Harris's support may be largely name-recognition based, she has institutional advantages as the most recent Democratic presidential nominee and maintains strong support among key Democratic constituencies.

(3) CALIFORNIA LIBERAL VULNERABILITY: Multiple sources highlight concerns about Newsom being perceived as a "California liberal" or "coastal elite" (Source 3: Newsweek, June 2025). This perception could significantly damage his electability in crucial Rust Belt swing states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, where Democrats struggled in 2024. An Emerson poll found 59% of California voters don't think Newsom should run for president in 2028 (Source 5: Newsweek, May 2025).

(4) MIXED POLLING SIGNALS: While some polls show Newsom's support surging following high-profile confrontations with Trump over immigration policy (Source 6: Newsweek, June 2025), other polls reveal diminishing prospects. A co/efficient poll found only 2% of likely voters see Newsom as the face of the Democratic Party, compared to 26% for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (Source 5: Newsweek, May 2025).

(5) CROWDED FIELD DYNAMICS: The research indicates a potentially crowded primary field including Pete Buttigieg, Gretchen Whitmer, Josh Shapiro, Andy Beshear, and others (Sources 1, 8). In a fragmented field, Newsom's progressive credentials and political network could be advantageous (Source 2: CalMatters, July 2024), but the outcome becomes highly dependent on how the field consolidates.

(6) TIME HORIZON UNCERTAINTY: With over three years until the 2028 primaries, the political landscape could shift dramatically. Party dynamics, economic conditions, and unforeseen events could elevate or diminish any candidate's prospects significantly.

### Confidence Reasoning
(1) CONTRADICTORY POLLING DATA: The research presents highly inconsistent polling results across different time periods and methodologies. For example, Emerson shows Harris leading at 37% vs Newsom at 7% (Source 1), while other polls show Newsom surging to 25% support (Source 4) and Polymarket shows him at 35% (Source 8). This inconsistency makes it difficult to assess true standing with confidence.

(2) LONG TIME HORIZON REDUCES CERTAINTY: We are currently over three years from the 2028 Democratic National Convention. Historical precedent shows that frontrunners this far out frequently fail to secure nominations. The political environment, candidate dynamics, and voter preferences can shift dramatically over such an extended period, significantly reducing predictive confidence.

(3) INCOMPLETE CANDIDATE FIELD: Several sources note that many potential candidates have not yet declared their intentions (Sources 1, 2, 3). The final composition of the primary field - particularly whether Harris runs and how many serious candidates enter - will fundamentally alter the dynamics in ways we cannot currently predict.

(4) QUALITY CONCERNS WITH SOME SOURCES: While some sources are reputable (Newsweek, CalMatters, Emerson polling), others like the California Globe (Source 4) present speculative analysis about potential running mates that may not reflect serious campaign planning. The Polymarket data (Source 8) represents betting markets rather than voter sentiment, which can diverge from actual outcomes.

(5) LIMITED SWING STATE DATA: Most polling and analysis focuses on national Democratic voters or California voters specifically. There is insufficient data on how Newsom would perform in crucial early primary states (Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina) or among the specific demographic groups that drive Democratic primary outcomes.

(6) CONFLICTING NARRATIVES ON MOMENTUM: Sources present contradictory narratives - some showing Newsom's chances "surging" (Source 6) while others show them "dimming" (Source 5), often within the same time period. This suggests the data is capturing noise rather than clear trends.

(7) PARTIAL RESEARCH COVERAGE: While the research provides valuable insights into Newsom's positioning and polling, it lacks comprehensive coverage of other major candidates' strengths, campaign infrastructure development, fundraising capacity, and endorsement patterns - all critical factors in primary outcomes.

### Summary
Gavin Newsom, the Governor of California, is emerging as a potential frontrunner for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, especially as doubts grow around Vice President Kamala Harris's viability following her loss to Donald Trump. While Harris currently leads in early polling, much of her support stems from name recognition rather than strong backing for her candidacy. Many Democrats express a preference for alternative candidates, with nearly 36% indicating they would like to see someone other than Harris as a leading voice for the party.

Newsom has been actively positioning himself as a key player in the Democratic landscape, particularly in opposition to Trump, while also signaling a willingness to collaborate with the incoming administration. His strategic moves since mid-2023, including a notable debate with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, have helped elevate his national profile. Despite competition from other potential candidates like Gretchen Whitmer and Pete Buttigieg, Newsom's established presence and centrist approach may enhance his chances in a crowded primary field. However, the outcome remains uncertain as the political landscape evolves leading up to the election.

### Key Highlights
- President-elect Donald Trump has yet to be sworn in, but Democrats have already begun jockeying to see who could emerge in pole position for the 2028 election. Despite Democrats’ claims to have a deep bench, there is really only one with enough of a national profile to be considered a potential front runner: California Governor Gavin Newsom. To be sure, while Vice President Kamala Harris would theoretically be the presumed front runner, her loss to Donald Trump raises doubts as to Harris’ future viability, and even her aspirations.
- Further, with Newsom positioning himself as _the_ leader in Democrats’ impending fights with the Trump administration, his profile seems set to rise exponentially within the party. Importantly, while promising to lead the “resistance” against Trump where necessary, Newsom has also made clear that he is [open](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5027371-newsom-lines-up-resistance-to-trumps-second-term/) to working with the incoming president, likely hoping to come off as willing to put the common good over a “resistance-at-all-costs” approach.
- Of course, this is not to disparage Harris, who stepped into an unprecedented role after President Biden withdrew from the race in late July. According to post-election [polling](https://emersoncollegepolling.com/november-2024-national-poll-trump-favorability-jumps-post-election-2028-election-kicks-off-with-harris-and-vance-leading-primaries/) from Emerson, Harris was the top choice among Democrats for 2028 (37%), well ahead of Newsom (7%). And yet, this far out from 2028, Harris’ lead is almost entirely due to name recognition, rather than a genuine desire for her to run again or a belief that she is even the best candidate to lead the party forward.

President-elect Donald Trump has yet to be sworn in, but Democrats have already begun jockeying to see who could emerge in pole position for the 2028 election.

Despite Democrats’ claims to have a deep bench, there is really only one with enough of a national profile to be considered a potential front runner: California Governor Gavin Newsom.

To be sure, while Vice President Kamala Harris would theoretically be the presumed front runner, her loss to Donald Trump raises doubts as to Harris’ future viability, and even her aspirations.

Of course, this is not to disparage Harris, who stepped into an unprecedented role after President Biden withdrew from the race in late July. According to post-election [polling](https://emersoncollegepolling.com/november-2024-national-poll-trump-favorability-jumps-post-election-2028-election-kicks-off-with-harris-and-vance-leading-primaries/) from Emerson, Harris was the top choice among Democrats for 2028 (37%), well ahead of Newsom (7%).

And yet, this far out from 2028, Harris’ lead is almost entirely due to name recognition, rather than a genuine desire for her to run again or a belief that she is even the best candidate to lead the party forward.

A considerable share of Democrats seem to recognize this. Nearly 4-in-10 (36%) Democrats said they prefer someone other than Harris to be “a leading voice for Democrats” per Echelon Insights [polling](https://echelonin.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/December-2024-Voter-Omnibus-Topline-EXTERNAL.pdf).

Moreover, there are questions as to whether or not Harris is even interested in another presidential bid. _The Hill_ has reported that some Democratic i

### Summary
The article discusses the potential of California Governor Gavin Newsom as a candidate for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, especially in light of concerns about President Joe Biden's viability for re-election. While Newsom has publicly supported Biden and denied any presidential ambitions, his rising national profile and political experience position him as a strong contender for future elections. Political experts suggest that, despite the challenges of being a California Democrat, Newsom's charisma, campaign skills, and progressive credentials could make him a formidable candidate in 2028, especially if Biden were to step aside. However, the presence of Vice President Kamala Harris as a likely candidate complicates his path to the nomination. Overall, while Newsom may not be the nominee in 2024, he is viewed as a significant player for the 2028 race.

### Key Highlights
- Ron DeSantis and a heretofore unsuccessful bid for [a constitutional amendment on gun control](https://calmatters.org/politics/2024/06/gavin-newsom-guns-constitutional-amendment/). CalMatters spoke with political consultants and experts — veterans of California elections, swing state organizing and national campaigns — about Newsom’s prospects as a presidential contender. They largely agreed that he was extremely unlikely to become the Democratic nominee this year even if Biden ultimately withdraws, with Vice President Kamala Harris waiting in the wings, but that Newsom could be a strong candidate in the 2028 primary because of his progressive bona fides and extensive political network.
- If Biden sticks around, the next Democratic presidential nominee will be chosen through the 2028 primaries. Those are decided by a more liberal subset of the electorate that may be drawn to a candidate like Newsom with a history of bold progressive governance — from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples as mayor of San Francisco in 2004 to [declaring a moratorium on executions](https://calmatters.org/justice/2019/03/gavin-newsom-halts-executions-california/) in California not long after he entered the governor’s office in 2019.

**In summary**

As Democrats have panicked over President Joe Biden’s lackluster debate performance and looked elsewhere for a potential replacement, California Gov. Gavin Newsom is the talk of the town. But how would he fare on the national stage?

_Lea esta historia en [Español](https://calmatters.org/calmatters-en-espanol/2024/07/california-gobernador-gavin-newsom-presidente-candidato/)_

In the nearly two weeks since President Joe Biden’s catastrophic performance in a televised debate, the Democratic freakout over whether he can continue as their presumptive presidential nominee has not abated.

Even as Biden insists that he is committed to finishing out the race, speculation continues among the party faithful and political observers over who might be best positioned to defeat Republican former President Donald Trump instead. Among those frequently cited is California’s own Gov. [Gavin Newsom](https://calmatters.org/tag/gavin-newsom/), a dedicated Biden surrogate who recently completed a tour on the president’s behalf through Michigan, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire.

While Newsom says he’s standing firmly behind Biden’s re-election and has long publicly denied any presidential ambitions, this chaotic political moment

### Summary
Gavin Newsom's prospects for winning the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination have improved significantly, as indicated by two recent polls. Although he has not officially declared his candidacy, he is seen as a strong potential candidate, especially in light of his opposition to President Trump's policies and his active role in responding to recent protests in California. Newsom's confrontations with Trump, particularly regarding the federalization of National Guard troops during the protests, have garnered him national attention and positioned him as a key figure in the Democratic landscape. Other prominent Democrats, such as Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg, may also enter the race, making the primary competitive. Overall, while Newsom's chances appear to be rising, the outcome will depend on various factors, including the dynamics of the primary race and the candidates that emerge.

## Source 4: Gavin Newsom Could Choose AOC as 2028 Running Mate – California Globe
URL: https://californiaglobe.com/fr/greenberg-gavin-newsom-could-choose-aoc-as-2028-running-mate/
Published: 2025-09-27T00:00:00.000Z

### Summary
Gavin Newsom is currently positioned as a frontrunner for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, with polls indicating he has nearly 25% support among Democratic voters. His handling of key issues and a strong national profile bolster his candidacy. If he secures the nomination, his choice of running mate will be crucial for uniting the party, particularly against a likely Republican opponent, Vice President JD Vance.

One potential running mate is Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC), whose progressive appeal and demographic reach could energize the Democratic base. AOC's youth and strong support among younger voters make her an attractive choice, especially after the party's struggles in the 2024 election. However, her polarizing reputation could alienate moderates, posing a risk in swing states.

Despite concerns, AOC has shown adaptability in her political approach, collaborating with Newsom on issues like anti-gerrymandering. If she can align her messaging with Newsom's while maintaining her progressive core, they could form a powerful ticket. The combination of Newsom's experience and AOC's energy could mirror successful historical pairings, potentially maximizing voter enthusiasm and turnout.

In summary, while Newsom's nomination appears likely, the dynamics of his running mate choice, particularly with AOC, will be critical in shaping his campaign and addressing the challenges the Democratic Party faces moving forward.

### Key Highlights
- As the faltering Democratic Party looks toward the 2028 presidential election, California Governor Gavin Newsom currently stands as the frontrunner for the party’s nomination, bolstered by his national profile and handling (controversially) of high-stakes issues like immigration and gerrymandering. With polls showing him rising to nearly 25% among Democratic voters (and betting markets like Polymarket now giving him a 20% chance of securing the nomination), Newsom’s trajectory upwards appears strong.
- Should he clinch the nomination in a little less than 3 years from now, his choice of running mate will be pivotal in uniting a fractured party to counter the Republican field, likely led by Vice President JD Vance. Newsom could select Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) as his vice presidential running mate, leveraging her near-universal name recognition, her progressive energy and demographic appeal.
- She would need to adapt her public tone to align with his, thereby creating a formidable ticket to reclaim the White House. AOC’s selection would make strategic sense for Newsom, who must balance ideological and demographic dynamics to rebuild the Democratic coalition post-2024 debacle. At 57, Newsom is a seasoned politician with executive experience. However, his California roots and strong of failures invite skepticism in Rust Belt swing states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, where Democrats faltered in 2024.

### Summary
A recent poll indicates that California Governor Gavin Newsom's chances of winning the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination are diminishing. Conducted by co/efficient, the survey found that only 2% of likely voters view Newsom as the face of the Democratic Party. In contrast, 26% of respondents identified New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as the party's leading figure, with the same percentage stating that "no one" represents the party. Although Newsom has not officially declared his candidacy, his ability to emerge as a unifying candidate in the post-Trump era is being questioned, especially following the Democratic Party's struggles after the 2024 elections.

### Key Highlights
- Newsom has not said whether he plans to run for the White House, but has long been rumored to be considering a 2028 bid. But Newsom's ability to position himself as a unifying or compelling figure for the post-Trump era could be called into question. Following election losses across the board in 2024, the Democratic Party has gone through infighting and struggled to unify around a clear successor at the top leading for some calls to rally behind a new generation of leadership.

- But these attempts to broaden his appeal appear to have fallen flat, some polls showing little appetite for a 2028 bid from Newsom.

Gavin Newsom's prospects for winning the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination have improved significantly, according to a recent poll. His visibility and support surged following his response to protests in Los Angeles related to Donald Trump's immigration policies, where he positioned himself as a strong opponent to the Trump administration. Newsom's actions, including a lawsuit against the federalization of National Guard troops, have garnered praise from many Democrats. As a result, his support in hypothetical matchups against other candidates has increased since March, indicating a growing favorability among party members.

- Still, Newsom's handling of the protests has earned praise from many Democrats, and the latest poll finds that his support against other hypothetical candidates has ticked up since March. Newsom's support more than doubled in the latest poll of Democratic voters conducted by Morning Consult, though former Vice President [Kamala Harris](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/kamala-harris) still held a strong lead over other potential candidates.
- Newsom has long been viewed as a likely presidential candidate for [Democrats](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/democrats), and has presented himself as a foil and leading opponent to the Trump administration. The Los Angeles protests earlier presented him with perhaps his highest-profile clash against the president so far. His big moment came when Trump federalized National Guard troops, arguing local officials were not doing enough to quell demonstrations that at times grew violent, though most protesters were peaceful.

### Summary
The article discusses the growing alliance between President Joe Biden and California Governor Gavin Newsom, suggesting that Newsom is being positioned as a potential successor for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination. Political analysts indicate that Biden may offer Newsom a prominent role at the Democratic nominating convention to bolster his 2028 aspirations. Despite some concerns within the Democratic Party about Biden's candidacy for 2024, Newsom has publicly supported him, dismissing the idea of an alternative candidate. This relationship could enhance Newsom's visibility and support within the party, potentially increasing his chances for the nomination in 2028. However, the outcome will depend on various factors, including Biden's performance in the 2024 election and the evolving political landscape.

### Key Highlights
- President Biden could offer California Governor [Gavin Newsom](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/gavin-newsom) "a high-profile spot at the nominating convention" to "tee up his likely 2028 run," should Biden win re-election in 2024, according to a leading political scientist. The move is the latest sign in a burgeoning alliance between Biden and Newsom, who previously had a tense relationship, triggering speculation the California governor is being viewed in the White House as a natural successor for 2028.
- Politics at King's College London, argued the blossoming alliance between Biden and Newsom is mutually beneficial and suggested it could help prepare the California governor for a presidential run in 2028. He commented: "At this point, Biden is looking to cozy up to just about any prominent Democrat who will go on the record lavishly praising him, including Newsom.
- Newsom is enthusiastically supporting Biden's re-election campaign, even as some [Democrats](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/democrats) are raising concerns about his candidacy [following a series of gaffes](https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-suffers-two-speech-gaffes-just-over-24-hours-1829155) by the 80-year-old president and some polling putting him [behind Republican front-runner Donald Trump](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-poll-joe-biden-washington-post-1829608). Speaking to _The New York Times_ earlier in September Newsom rejected the suggestion Democrats could nominate somebody other than Biden as their 2024 candidate, commenting: "The train has left the station…We're all in.

While Harris currently leads in early polling, much of her support stems from name recognition rather than strong backing for her candidacy. Many Democrats express a preference for alternative candidates, with nearly 36% indicating they would like to see someone other than Harris as a leading voice for the party.\n\nNewsom has been actively positioning himself as a key player in the Democratic landscape, particularly in opposition to Trump, while also signaling a willingness to collaborate with the incoming administration. His strategic moves since mid-2023, including a notable debate with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, have helped elevate his national profile. Despite competition from other potential candidates like Gretchen Whitmer and Pete Buttigieg, Newsom's established presence and centrist approach may enhance his chances in a crowded primary field. However, the outcome remains uncertain as the political landscape evolves leading up to the election.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- President-elect Donald Trump has yet to be sworn in, but Democrats have already begun jockeying to see who could emerge in pole position for the 2028 election. Despite Democrats’ claims to have a deep bench, there is really only one with enough of a national profile to be considered a potential front runner: California Governor Gavin Newsom. To be sure, while Vice President Kamala Harris would theoretically be the presumed front runner, her loss to Donald Trump raises doubts as to Harris’ future viability, and even her aspirations.\n- Further, with Newsom positioning himself as _the_ leader in Democrats’ impending fights with the Trump administration, his profile seems set to rise exponentially within the party. Importantly, while promising to lead the “resistance” against Trump where necessary, Newsom has also made clear that he is [open](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5027371-newsom-lines-up-resistance-to-trumps-second-term/) to working with the incoming president, likely hoping to come off as willing to put the common good over a “resistance-at-all-costs” approach.\n- Of course, this is not to disparage Harris, who stepped into an unprecedented role after President Biden withdrew from the race in late July. According to post-election [polling](https://emersoncollegepolling.com/november-2024-national-poll-trump-favorability-jumps-post-election-2028-election-kicks-off-with-harris-and-vance-leading-primaries/) from Emerson, Harris was the top choice among Democrats for 2028 (37%), well ahead of Newsom (7%). And yet, this far out from 2028, Harris’ lead is almost entirely due to name recognition, rather than a genuine desire for her to run again or a belief that she is even the best candidate to lead the party forward.\n\n### Content\n[Skip to content](https://www.ocregister.com/www.ocregister.com#content)\n\nCalifornia Gov.

While Newsom has publicly supported Biden and denied any presidential ambitions, his rising national profile and political experience position him as a strong contender for future elections. Political experts suggest that, despite the challenges of being a California Democrat, Newsom's charisma, campaign skills, and progressive credentials could make him a formidable candidate in 2028, especially if Biden were to step aside. However, the presence of Vice President Kamala Harris as a likely candidate complicates his path to the nomination. Overall, while Newsom may not be the nominee in 2024, he is viewed as a significant player for the 2028 race.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Ron DeSantis and a heretofore unsuccessful bid for [a constitutional amendment on gun control](https://calmatters.org/politics/2024/06/gavin-newsom-guns-constitutional-amendment/). CalMatters spoke with political consultants and experts — veterans of California elections, swing state organizing and national campaigns — about Newsom’s prospects as a presidential contender. They largely agreed that he was extremely unlikely to become the Democratic nominee this year even if Biden ultimately withdraws, with Vice President Kamala Harris waiting in the wings, but that Newsom could be a strong candidate in the 2028 primary because of his progressive bona fides and extensive political network.\n- If Biden sticks around, the next Democratic presidential nominee will be chosen through the 2028 primaries. Those are decided by a more liberal subset of the electorate that may be drawn to a candidate like Newsom with a history of bold progressive governance — from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples as mayor of San Francisco in 2004 to [declaring a moratorium on executions](https://calmatters.org/justice/2019/03/gavin-newsom-halts-executions-california/) in California not long after he entered the governor’s office in 2019.\n- Gov.

Among those frequently cited is California’s own Gov. [Gavin Newsom](https://calmatters.org/tag/gavin-newsom/), a dedicated Biden surrogate who recently completed a tour on the president’s behalf through Michigan, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire.\n\nWhile Newsom says he’s standing firmly behind Biden’s re-election and has long publicly denied any presidential ambitions, this chaotic political moment \n\n---\n\n## Source 3: Gavin Newsom's Chances of Being 2028 Nominee Jump in Two Polls in One Week\nURL: https://newsweek.com/gavin-newsom-chances-being-2028-nominee-jump-two-polls-2088447\nPublished: 2025-06-20T15:24:55.000Z\nAuthor: Andrew Stanton\n\n### Summary\nGavin Newsom's prospects for winning the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination have improved significantly, as indicated by two recent polls. Although he has not officially declared his candidacy, he is seen as a strong potential candidate, especially in light of his opposition to President Trump's policies and his active role in responding to recent protests in California. Newsom's confrontations with Trump, particularly regarding the federalization of National Guard troops during the protests, have garnered him national attention and positioned him as a key figure in the Democratic landscape. Other prominent Democrats, such as Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg, may also enter the race, making the primary competitive. Overall, while Newsom's chances appear to be rising, the outcome will depend on various factors, including the dynamics of the primary race and the candidates that emerge.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- [Newsletters](https://www.newsweek.com/preference-center) [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Newsweek) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/newsweek) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/newsweek) [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@newsweek) [Twitter/X](https://x.com/newsweek) [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/newsweek/) [Announcements](https://www.newsweek.com/announcements) California Governor [Gavin Newsom](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/gavin-newsom)'s chances of winning the 2028 Democratic primary increased in a second poll following the Los Angeles protests over President [Donald Trump](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/donald-trump)'s immigration policies.\n- Newsom has not formally said he's planning to run in the primary, which could draw other high profile names including former Vice President [Kamala Harris](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/kamala-harris) and former Transportation Secretary [Pete Buttigieg](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/pete-buttigieg). But he is viewed as a potential candidate by [Democrats](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/democrats). The governor has cast himself as a foil to President Donald Trump following his return to office, and has attracted national attention over his opposition to the president's policies.\n- While Newsom's message may be resonating with Democratic voters, a challenge for him would be to show he is not a \"California liberal\" or \"coastal elite,\" attacks that [Republicans](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/republicans) are likely to throw at him if he becomes the nominee, Danehy said. Protests began after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( [ICE](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/ice)) began conducting raids in Los Angeles earlier in June to fulfill Trump's promise of mass deportations.\n\n### Content\n- Nation\n\n[News](https://www.newsweek.com/news) [Politics](https://www.newsweek.com/politics) [Tech](https://www.newsweek.com/technology) [Fact Check](https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check) [Personal Finance](https://www.newsweek.com/personal-finance) [Automotive](https://www.newsweek.com/autos) [Sports](https://www.newsweek.com/sports) [Better Workplaces](https://www.newsweek.com/better-workplaces)\n\n- World\n\n[Russia-Ukraine](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/russia) [Middle East](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/middle-east) [China And Asia](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/china) [Better Planet](https://www.newsweek.com/better-planet) [All World News](https://www.newsweek.com/world)\n\n- Lifestyle\n\n[Family & Parenting](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/parenting) [Entertainment](https://www.newsweek.com/entertainment) [Travel](https://www.newsweek.com/travel) [Pets](https://www.newsweek.com/pets) [Relationships](https://www.newsweek.com/relationships) [Science](https://www.newsweek.com/tech-science) [Health](https://www.newsweek.com/health)\n\n- Opinion\n\n[My Turn](https://www.newsweek.com/my-turn) [All Opinion](https://www.newsweek.com/opinion)\n\n- Rankings\n\n[Health](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/health) [Finance](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/finance) [Products](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/products-services) [Education](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/education) [Workplaces](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/work) [Corporate Responsibility](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/corporate-responsibility) [All Rankings](https://rankings.newsweek.com/)\n\n- Connect\n\n[Newsletters](https://www.newsweek.com/preference-center) [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Newsweek) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/newsweek) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/newsweek) [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@newsweek) [Twitter/X](https://x.com/newsweek) [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/newsweek/) [Announcements](https://www.newsweek.com/announcements)\n\n- Mo\n\n---\n\n## Source 4: Gavin Newsom Could Choose AOC as 2028 Running Mate – California Globe\nURL: https://californiaglobe.com/fr/greenberg-gavin-newsom-could-choose-aoc-as-2028-running-mate/\nPublished: 2025-09-27T00:00:00.000Z\n\n### Summary\nGavin Newsom is currently positioned as a frontrunner for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, with polls indicating he has nearly 25% support among Democratic voters. His handling of key issues and a strong national profile bolster his candidacy. If he secures the nomination, his choice of running mate will be crucial for uniting the party, particularly against a likely Republican opponent, Vice President JD Vance.\n\nOne potential running mate is Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC), whose progressive appeal and demographic reach could energize the Democratic base. AOC's youth and strong support among younger voters make her an attractive choice, especially after the party's struggles in the 2024 election. However, her polarizing reputation could alienate moderates, posing a risk in swing states.\n\nDespite concerns, AOC has shown adaptability in her political approach, collaborating with Newsom on issues like anti-gerrymandering. If she can align her messaging with Newsom's while maintaining her progressive core, they could form a powerful ticket. The combination of Newsom's experience and AOC's energy could mirror successful historical pairings, potentially maximizing voter enthusiasm and turnout.\n\nIn summary, while Newsom's nomination appears likely, the dynamics of his running mate choice, particularly with AOC, will be critical in shaping his campaign and addressing the challenges the Democratic Party faces moving forward.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- As the faltering Democratic Party looks toward the 2028 presidential election, California Governor Gavin Newsom currently stands as the frontrunner for the party’s nomination, bolstered by his national profile and handling (controversially) of high-stakes issues like immigration and gerrymandering. With polls showing him rising to nearly 25% among Democratic voters (and betting markets like Polymarket now giving him a 20% chance of securing the nomination), Newsom’s trajectory upwards appears strong.\n- Should he clinch the nomination in a little less than 3 years from now, his choice of running mate will be pivotal in uniting a fractured party to counter the Republican field, likely led by Vice President JD Vance. Newsom could select Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) as his vice presidential running mate, leveraging her near-universal name recognition, her progressive energy and demographic appeal.\n- She would need to adapt her public tone to align with his, thereby creating a formidable ticket to reclaim the White House. AOC’s selection would make strategic sense for Newsom, who must balance ideological and demographic dynamics to rebuild the Democratic coalition post-2024 debacle. At 57, Newsom is a seasoned politician with executive experience. However, his California roots and strong of failures invite skepticism in Rust Belt swing states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, where Democrats faltered in 2024.\n\n### Content\n[Home](https://californiaglobe.com/)>[Governor](https://californiaglobe.com/topics/governor/)>Greenberg: Gavin Newsom Could Choose AOC as 2028 Running Mate\n\nA Gavin Newsom/AOC ticket?\n\n27 Sep 20253:30 am\n\nAs the faltering Democratic Party looks toward the 2028 presidential election, California Governor Gavin Newsom currently stands as the frontrunner for the party’s nomination, bolstered by his national profile and handling (controversially) of high-stakes issues like immigration and gerrymandering.

Conducted by co/efficient, the survey found that only 2% of likely voters view Newsom as the face of the Democratic Party. In contrast, 26% of respondents identified New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as the party's leading figure, with the same percentage stating that \"no one\" represents the party. Although Newsom has not officially declared his candidacy, his ability to emerge as a unifying candidate in the post-Trump era is being questioned, especially following the Democratic Party's struggles after the 2024 elections.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Newsom has not said whether he plans to run for the White House, but has long been rumored to be considering a 2028 bid. But Newsom's ability to position himself as a unifying or compelling figure for the post-Trump era could be called into question. Following election losses across the board in 2024, the Democratic Party has gone through infighting and struggled to unify around a clear successor at the top leading for some calls to rally behind a new generation of leadership.\n- [Newsletters](https://www.newsweek.com/preference-center) [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Newsweek) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/newsweek) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/newsweek) [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@newsweek) [Twitter/X](https://x.com/newsweek) [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/newsweek/) [Announcements](https://www.newsweek.com/announcements) A new poll, conducted by co/efficient between May 7 and May 9 among 1,462 likely voters, found that just 2 percent of voters see Newsom as the face of the [Democratic Party](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/democratic-party).

His visibility and support surged following his response to protests in Los Angeles related to Donald Trump's immigration policies, where he positioned himself as a strong opponent to the Trump administration. Newsom's actions, including a lawsuit against the federalization of National Guard troops, have garnered praise from many Democrats.

Political analysts indicate that Biden may offer Newsom a prominent role at the Democratic nominating convention to bolster his 2028 aspirations. Despite some concerns within the Democratic Party about Biden's candidacy for 2024, Newsom has publicly supported him, dismissing the idea of an alternative candidate. This relationship could enhance Newsom's visibility and support within the party, potentially increasing his chances for the nomination in 2028. However, the outcome will depend on various factors, including Biden's performance in the 2024 election and the evolving political landscape.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- President Biden could offer California Governor [Gavin Newsom](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/gavin-newsom) \"a high-profile spot at the nominating convention\" to \"tee up his likely 2028 run,\" should Biden win re-election in 2024, according to a leading political scientist. The move is the latest sign in a burgeoning alliance between Biden and Newsom, who previously had a tense relationship, triggering speculation the California governor is being viewed in the White House as a natural successor for 2028.\n- Politics at King's College London, argued the blossoming alliance between Biden and Newsom is mutually beneficial and suggested it could help prepare the California governor for a presidential run in 2028.

While Harris currently leads in early polling, much of her support stems from name recognition rather than strong backing for her candidacy. Many Democrats express a preference for alternative candidates, with nearly 36% indicating they would like to see someone other than Harris as a leading voice for the party.\n\nNewsom has been actively positioning himself as a key player in the Democratic landscape, particularly in opposition to Trump, while also signaling a willingness to collaborate with the incoming administration. His strategic moves since mid-2023, including a notable debate with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, have helped elevate his national profile. Despite competition from other potential candidates like Gretchen Whitmer and Pete Buttigieg, Newsom's established presence and centrist approach may enhance his chances in a crowded primary field. However, the outcome remains uncertain as the political landscape evolves leading up to the election.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- President-elect Donald Trump has yet to be sworn in, but Democrats have already begun jockeying to see who could emerge in pole position for the 2028 election. Despite Democrats’ claims to have a deep bench, there is really only one with enough of a national profile to be considered a potential front runner: California Governor Gavin Newsom. To be sure, while Vice President Kamala Harris would theoretically be the presumed front runner, her loss to Donald Trump raises doubts as to Harris’ future viability, and even her aspirations.\n- Further, with Newsom positioning himself as _the_ leader in Democrats’ impending fights with the Trump administration, his profile seems set to rise exponentially within the party. Importantly, while promising to lead the “resistance” against Trump where necessary, Newsom has also made clear that he is [open](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5027371-newsom-lines-up-resistance-to-trumps-second-term/) to working with the incoming president, likely hoping to come off as willing to put the common good over a “resistance-at-all-costs” approach.\n- Of course, this is not to disparage Harris, who stepped into an unprecedented role after President Biden withdrew from the race in late July. According to post-election [polling](https://emersoncollegepolling.com/november-2024-national-poll-trump-favorability-jumps-post-election-2028-election-kicks-off-with-harris-and-vance-leading-primaries/) from Emerson, Harris was the top choice among Democrats for 2028 (37%), well ahead of Newsom (7%). And yet, this far out from 2028, Harris’ lead is almost entirely due to name recognition, rather than a genuine desire for her to run again or a belief that she is even the best candidate to lead the party forward.\n\n### Content\n[Skip to content](https://www.ocregister.com/www.ocregister.com#content)\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom talks about the state’s border priorities at Otay Mesa on Thursday. (Nelvin C. Cepeda / The San Diego Union-Tribune)\n\nBy [Douglas Schoen](https://www.ocregister.com/author/douglas-schoen/)\n\nUPDATED: January 5, 2025 at 11:15 PM PST\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has yet to be sworn in, but Democrats have already begun jockeying to see who could emerge in pole position for the 2028 election.\n\nDespite Democrats’ claims to have a deep bench, there is really only one with enough of a national profile to be considered a potential front runner: California Governor Gavin Newsom.\n\nTo be sure, while Vice President Kamala Harris would theoretically be the presumed front runner, her loss to Donald Trump raises doubts as to Harris’ future viability, and even her aspirations.\n\nOf course, this is not to disparage Harris, who stepped into an unprecedented role after President Biden withdrew from the race in late July.

Tallying up his assets and liabilities\nURL: https://calmatters.org/politics/elections/2024/07/gavin-newsom-for-president-assets-liabilities/\nPublished: 2024-07-10T12:35:00.000Z\nAuthor: Alexei Koseff, Yue Stella Yu\n\n### Summary\nThe article discusses the potential of California Governor Gavin Newsom as a candidate for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, especially in light of concerns about President Joe Biden's viability for re-election. While Newsom has publicly supported Biden and denied any presidential ambitions, his rising national profile and political experience position him as a strong contender for future elections. Political experts suggest that, despite the challenges of being a California Democrat, Newsom's charisma, campaign skills, and progressive credentials could make him a formidable candidate in 2028, especially if Biden were to step aside. However, the presence of Vice President Kamala Harris as a likely candidate complicates his path to the nomination. Overall, while Newsom may not be the nominee in 2024, he is viewed as a significant player for the 2028 race.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Ron DeSantis and a heretofore unsuccessful bid for [a constitutional amendment on gun control](https://calmatters.org/politics/2024/06/gavin-newsom-guns-constitutional-amendment/). CalMatters spoke with political consultants and experts — veterans of California elections, swing state organizing and national campaigns — about Newsom’s prospects as a presidential contender. They largely agreed that he was extremely unlikely to become the Democratic nominee this year even if Biden ultimately withdraws, with Vice President Kamala Harris waiting in the wings, but that Newsom could be a strong candidate in the 2028 primary because of his progressive bona fides and extensive political network.\n- If Biden sticks around, the next Democratic presidential nominee will be chosen through the 2028 primaries. Those are decided by a more liberal subset of the electorate that may be drawn to a candidate like Newsom with a history of bold progressive governance — from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples as mayor of San Francisco in 2004 to [declaring a moratorium on executions](https://calmatters.org/justice/2019/03/gavin-newsom-halts-executions-california/) in California not long after he entered the governor’s office in 2019.\n- Gov.

Gavin Newsom is the talk of the town. But how would he fare on the national stage?\n\n_Lea esta historia en [Español](https://calmatters.org/calmatters-en-espanol/2024/07/california-gobernador-gavin-newsom-presidente-candidato/)_\n\nIn the nearly two weeks since President Joe Biden’s catastrophic performance in a televised debate, the Democratic freakout over whether he can continue as their presumptive presidential nominee has not abated.\n\nEven as Biden insists that he is committed to finishing out the race, speculation continues among the party faithful and political observers over who might be best positioned to defeat Republican former President Donald Trump instead. Among those frequently cited is California’s own Gov. [Gavin Newsom](https://calmatters.org/tag/gavin-newsom/), a dedicated Biden surrogate who recently completed a tour on the president’s behalf through Michigan, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire.\n\nWhile Newsom says he’s standing firmly behind Biden’s re-election and has long publicly denied any presidential ambitions, this chaotic political moment \n\n---\n\n## Source 3: Gavin Newsom's Chances of Being 2028 Nominee Jump in Two Polls in One Week\nURL: https://newsweek.com/gavin-newsom-chances-being-2028-nominee-jump-two-polls-2088447\nPublished: 2025-06-20T15:24:55.000Z\nAuthor: Andrew Stanton\n\n### Summary\nGavin Newsom's prospects for winning the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination have improved significantly, as indicated by two recent polls. Although he has not officially declared his candidacy, he is seen as a strong potential candidate, especially in light of his opposition to President Trump's policies and his active role in responding to recent protests in California. Newsom's confrontations with Trump, particularly regarding the federalization of National Guard troops during the protests, have garnered him national attention and positioned him as a key figure in the Democratic landscape. Other prominent Democrats, such as Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg, may also enter the race, making the primary competitive. Overall, while Newsom's chances appear to be rising, the outcome will depend on various factors, including the dynamics of the primary race and the candidates that emerge.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- [Newsletters](https://www.newsweek.com/preference-center) [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Newsweek) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/newsweek) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/newsweek) [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@newsweek) [Twitter/X](https://x.com/newsweek) [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/newsweek/) [Announcements](https://www.newsweek.com/announcements) California Governor [Gavin Newsom](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/gavin-newsom)'s chances of winning the 2028 Democratic primary increased in a second poll following the Los Angeles protests over President [Donald Trump](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/donald-trump)'s immigration policies.\n- Newsom has not formally said he's planning to run in the primary, which could draw other high profile names including former Vice President [Kamala Harris](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/kamala-harris) and former Transportation Secretary [Pete Buttigieg](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/pete-buttigieg). But he is viewed as a potential candidate by [Democrats](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/democrats). The governor has cast himself as a foil to President Donald Trump following his return to office, and has attracted national attention over his opposition to the president's policies.\n- While Newsom's message may be resonating with Democratic voters, a challenge for him would be to show he is not a \"California liberal\" or \"coastal elite,\" attacks that [Republicans](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/republicans) are likely to throw at him if he becomes the nominee, Danehy said. Protests began after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( [ICE](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/ice)) began conducting raids in Los Angeles earlier in June to fulfill Trump's promise of mass deportations.\n\n### Content\n- Nation\n\n[News](https://www.newsweek.com/news) [Politics](https://www.newsweek.com/politics) [Tech](https://www.newsweek.com/technology) [Fact Check](https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check) [Personal Finance](https://www.newsweek.com/personal-finance) [Automotive](https://www.newsweek.com/autos) [Sports](https://www.newsweek.com/sports) [Better Workplaces](https://www.newsweek.com/better-workplaces)\n\n- World\n\n[Russia-Ukraine](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/russia) [Middle East](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/middle-east) [China And Asia](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/china) [Better Planet](https://www.newsweek.com/better-planet) [All World News](https://www.newsweek.com/world)\n\n- Lifestyle\n\n[Family & Parenting](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/parenting) [Entertainment](https://www.newsweek.com/entertainment) [Travel](https://www.newsweek.com/travel) [Pets](https://www.newsweek.com/pets) [Relationships](https://www.newsweek.com/relationships) [Science](https://www.newsweek.com/tech-science) [Health](https://www.newsweek.com/health)\n\n- Opinion\n\n[My Turn](https://www.newsweek.com/my-turn) [All Opinion](https://www.newsweek.com/opinion)\n\n- Rankings\n\n[Health](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/health) [Finance](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/finance) [Products](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/products-services) [Education](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/education) [Workplaces](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/work) [Corporate Responsibility](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/corporate-responsibility) [All Rankings](https://rankings.newsweek.com/)\n\n- Connect\n\n[Newsletters](https://www.newsweek.com/preference-center) [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Newsweek) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/newsweek) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/newsweek) [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@newsweek) [Twitter/X](https://x.com/newsweek) [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/newsweek/) [Announcements](https://www.newsweek.com/announcements)\n\n- Mo\n\n---\n\n## Source 4: Gavin Newsom Could Choose AOC as 2028 Running Mate – California Globe\nURL: https://californiaglobe.com/fr/greenberg-gavin-newsom-could-choose-aoc-as-2028-running-mate/\nPublished: 2025-09-27T00:00:00.000Z\n\n### Summary\nGavin Newsom is currently positioned as a frontrunner for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, with polls indicating he has nearly 25% support among Democratic voters. His handling of key issues and a strong national profile bolster his candidacy. If he secures the nomination, his choice of running mate will be crucial for uniting the party, particularly against a likely Republican opponent, Vice President JD Vance.\n\nOne potential running mate is Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC), whose progressive appeal and demographic reach could energize the Democratic base. AOC's youth and strong support among younger voters make her an attractive choice, especially after the party's struggles in the 2024 election. However, her polarizing reputation could alienate moderates, posing a risk in swing states.\n\nDespite concerns, AOC has shown adaptability in her political approach, collaborating with Newsom on issues like anti-gerrymandering. If she can align her messaging with Newsom's while maintaining her progressive core, they could form a powerful ticket. The combination of Newsom's experience and AOC's energy could mirror successful historical pairings, potentially maximizing voter enthusiasm and turnout.\n\nIn summary, while Newsom's nomination appears likely, the dynamics of his running mate choice, particularly with AOC, will be critical in shaping his campaign and addressing the challenges the Democratic Party faces moving forward.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- As the faltering Democratic Party looks toward the 2028 presidential election, California Governor Gavin Newsom currently stands as the frontrunner for the party’s nomination, bolstered by his national profile and handling (controversially) of high-stakes issues like immigration and gerrymandering. With polls showing him rising to nearly 25% among Democratic voters (and betting markets like Polymarket now giving him a 20% chance of securing the nomination), Newsom’s trajectory upwards appears strong.\n- Should he clinch the nomination in a little less than 3 years from now, his choice of running mate will be pivotal in uniting a fractured party to counter the Republican field, likely led by Vice President JD Vance. Newsom could select Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) as his vice presidential running mate, leveraging her near-universal name recognition, her progressive energy and demographic appeal.\n- She would need to adapt her public tone to align with his, thereby creating a formidable ticket to reclaim the White House. AOC’s selection would make strategic sense for Newsom, who must balance ideological and demographic dynamics to rebuild the Democratic coalition post-2024 debacle. At 57, Newsom is a seasoned politician with executive experience. However, his California roots and strong of failures invite skepticism in Rust Belt swing states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, where Democrats faltered in 2024.\n\n### Content\n[Home](https://californiaglobe.com/)>[Governor](https://californiaglobe.com/topics/governor/)>Greenberg: Gavin Newsom Could Choose AOC as 2028 Running Mate\n\nA Gavin Newsom/AOC ticket?\n\n27 Sep 20253:30 am\n\nAs the faltering Democratic Party looks toward the 2028 presidential election, California Governor Gavin Newsom currently stands as the frontrunner for the party’s nomination, bolstered by his national profile and handling (controversially) of high-stakes issues like immigration and gerrymandering.

Conducted by co/efficient, the survey found that only 2% of likely voters view Newsom as the face of the Democratic Party. In contrast, 26% of respondents identified New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as the party's leading figure, with the same percentage stating that \"no one\" represents the party. Although Newsom has not officially declared his candidacy, his ability to emerge as a unifying candidate in the post-Trump era is being questioned, especially following the Democratic Party's struggles after the 2024 elections.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Newsom has not said whether he plans to run for the White House, but has long been rumored to be considering a 2028 bid. But Newsom's ability to position himself as a unifying or compelling figure for the post-Trump era could be called into question. Following election losses across the board in 2024, the Democratic Party has gone through infighting and struggled to unify around a clear successor at the top leading for some calls to rally behind a new generation of leadership.\n- [Newsletters](https://www.newsweek.com/preference-center) [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Newsweek) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/newsweek) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/newsweek) [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@newsweek) [Twitter/X](https://x.com/newsweek) [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/newsweek/) [Announcements](https://www.newsweek.com/announcements) A new poll, conducted by co/efficient between May 7 and May 9 among 1,462 likely voters, found that just 2 percent of voters see Newsom as the face of the [Democratic Party](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/democratic-party).

Political analysts indicate that Biden may offer Newsom a prominent role at the Democratic nominating convention to bolster his 2028 aspirations. Despite some concerns within the Democratic Party about Biden's candidacy for 2024, Newsom has publicly supported him, dismissing the idea of an alternative candidate. This relationship could enhance Newsom's visibility and support within the party, potentially increasing his chances for the nomination in 2028.

However, this falls short of a commanding lead that would suggest inevitability.\\n\\n(2) SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM KAMALA HARRIS: The research reveals a critical challenge - Vice President Kamala Harris remains a formidable competitor. Post-2024 election polling from Emerson showed Harris at 37% compared to Newsom's 7% (Source 1: OC Register, Jan 2025). While Harris's support may be largely name-recognition based, she has institutional advantages as the most recent Democratic presidential nominee and maintains strong support among key Democratic constituencies.\\n\\n(3) CALIFORNIA LIBERAL VULNERABILITY: Multiple sources highlight concerns about Newsom being perceived as a \\\"California liberal\\\" or \\\"coastal elite\\\" (Source 3: Newsweek, June 2025). This perception could significantly damage his electability in crucial Rust Belt swing states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, where Democrats struggled in 2024. An Emerson poll found 59% of California voters don't think Newsom should run for president in 2028 (Source 5: Newsweek, May 2025).\\n\\n(4) MIXED POLLING SIGNALS: While some polls show Newsom's support surging following high-profile confrontations with Trump over immigration policy (Source 6: Newsweek, June 2025), other polls reveal diminishing prospects. A co/efficient poll found only 2% of likely voters see Newsom as the face of the Democratic Party, compared to 26% for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (Source 5: Newsweek, May 2025).\\n\\n(5) CROWDED FIELD DYNAMICS: The research indicates a potentially crowded primary field including Pete Buttigieg, Gretchen Whitmer, Josh Shapiro, Andy Beshear, and others (Sources 1, 8). In a fragmented field, Newsom's progressive credentials and political network could be advantageous (Source 2: CalMatters, July 2024), but the outcome becomes highly dependent on how the field consolidates.\\n\\n(6) TIME HORIZON UNCERTAINTY: With over three years until the 2028 primaries, the political landscape could shift dramatically. Party dynamics, economic conditions, and unforeseen events could elevate or diminish any candidate's prospects significantly.\",\n    \"confidence\": 35,\n    \"confidenceReasoning\": \"(1) CONTRADICTORY POLLING DATA: The research presents highly inconsistent polling results across different time periods and methodologies. For example, Emerson shows Harris leading at 37% vs Newsom at 7% (Source 1), while other polls show Newsom surging to 25% support (Source 4) and Polymarket shows him at 35% (Source 8). This inconsistency makes it difficult to assess true standing with confidence.\\n\\n(2) LONG TIME HORIZON REDUCES CERTAINTY: We are currently over three years from the 2028 Democratic National Convention. Historical precedent shows that frontrunners this far out frequently fail to secure nominations. The political environment, candidate dynamics, and voter preferences can shift dramatically over such an extended period, significantly reducing predictive confidence.\\n\\n(3) INCOMPLETE CANDIDATE FIELD: Several sources note that many potential candidates have not yet declared their intentions (Sources 1, 2, 3). The final composition of the primary field - particularly whether Harris runs and how many serious candidates enter - will fundamentally alter the dynamics in ways we cannot currently predict.\\n\\n(4) QUALITY CONCERNS WITH SOME SOURCES: While some sources are reputable (Newsweek, CalMatters, Emerson polling), others like the California Globe (Source 4) present speculative analysis about potential running mates that may not reflect serious campaign planning. The Polymarket data (Source 8) represents betting markets rather than voter sentiment, which can diverge from actual outcomes.\\n\\n(5) LIMITED SWING STATE DATA: Most polling and analysis focuses on national Democratic voters or California voters specifically. There is insufficient data on how Newsom would perform in crucial early primary states (Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina) or among the specific demographic groups that drive Democratic primary outcomes.\\n\\n(6) CONFLICTING NARRATIVES ON MOMENTUM: Sources present contradictory narratives - some showing Newsom's chances \\\"surging\\\" (Source 6) while others show them \\\"dimming\\\" (Source 5), often within the same time period. This suggests the data is capturing noise rather than clear trends.\\n\\n(7) PARTIAL RESEARCH COVERAGE: While the research provides valuable insights into Newsom's positioning and polling, it lacks comprehensive coverage of other major candidates' strengths, campaign infrastructure development, fundraising capacity, and endorsement patterns - all critical factors in primary outcomes.\",\n    \"probability\": 38\n  },\n  \"keyFactors\": [\n    \"Kamala Harris's decision to run and her strength as the most recent Democratic nominee\",\n    \"Newsom's ability to overcome 'California liberal' perception in swing states\",\n    \"Size and composition of the final Democratic primary field\",\n    \"Economic conditions and political environment in 2027-2028\",\n    \"Newsom's performance in early primary states (Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina)\",\n    \"Success in building support among key Democratic constituencies (Black voters, young voters, progressives)\",\n    \"Fundraising capacity and campaign infrastructure development\",\n    \"Impact of continued Trump opposition positioning versus governing record in California\",\n    \"Endorsements from party establishment and progressive leaders\",\n    \"Performance in debates and campaign trail over the next 2-3 years\"\n  ],\n  \"dataQuality\": \"MEDIUM\",\n  \"lastUpdated\": \"2025-01-10T12:00:00Z\"\n}\n```",

While Harris currently leads in early polling, much of her support stems from name recognition rather than strong backing for her candidacy. Many Democrats express a preference for alternative candidates, with nearly 36% indicating they would like to see someone other than Harris as a leading voice for the party.\n\nNewsom has been actively positioning himself as a key player in the Democratic landscape, particularly in opposition to Trump, while also signaling a willingness to collaborate with the incoming administration. His strategic moves since mid-2023, including a notable debate with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, have helped elevate his national profile. Despite competition from other potential candidates like Gretchen Whitmer and Pete Buttigieg, Newsom's established presence and centrist approach may enhance his chances in a crowded primary field. However, the outcome remains uncertain as the political landscape evolves leading up to the election.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- President-elect Donald Trump has yet to be sworn in, but Democrats have already begun jockeying to see who could emerge in pole position for the 2028 election. Despite Democrats’ claims to have a deep bench, there is really only one with enough of a national profile to be considered a potential front runner: California Governor Gavin Newsom. To be sure, while Vice President Kamala Harris would theoretically be the presumed front runner, her loss to Donald Trump raises doubts as to Harris’ future viability, and even her aspirations.\n- Further, with Newsom positioning himself as _the_ leader in Democrats’ impending fights with the Trump administration, his profile seems set to rise exponentially within the party. Importantly, while promising to lead the “resistance” against Trump where necessary, Newsom has also made clear that he is [open](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5027371-newsom-lines-up-resistance-to-trumps-second-term/) to working with the incoming president, likely hoping to come off as willing to put the common good over a “resistance-at-all-costs” approach.\n- Of course, this is not to disparage Harris, who stepped into an unprecedented role after President Biden withdrew from the race in late July. According to post-election [polling](https://emersoncollegepolling.com/november-2024-national-poll-trump-favorability-jumps-post-election-2028-election-kicks-off-with-harris-and-vance-leading-primaries/) from Emerson, Harris was the top choice among Democrats for 2028 (37%), well ahead of Newsom (7%). And yet, this far out from 2028, Harris’ lead is almost entirely due to name recognition, rather than a genuine desire for her to run again or a belief that she is even the best candidate to lead the party forward.\n\n### Content\n[Skip to content](https://www.ocregister.com/www.ocregister.com#content)\n\nCalifornia Gov.

While Newsom has publicly supported Biden and denied any presidential ambitions, his rising national profile and political experience position him as a strong contender for future elections. Political experts suggest that, despite the challenges of being a California Democrat, Newsom's charisma, campaign skills, and progressive credentials could make him a formidable candidate in 2028, especially if Biden were to step aside. However, the presence of Vice President Kamala Harris as a likely candidate complicates his path to the nomination. Overall, while Newsom may not be the nominee in 2024, he is viewed as a significant player for the 2028 race.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Ron DeSantis and a heretofore unsuccessful bid for [a constitutional amendment on gun control](https://calmatters.org/politics/2024/06/gavin-newsom-guns-constitutional-amendment/). CalMatters spoke with political consultants and experts — veterans of California elections, swing state organizing and national campaigns — about Newsom’s prospects as a presidential contender. They largely agreed that he was extremely unlikely to become the Democratic nominee this year even if Biden ultimately withdraws, with Vice President Kamala Harris waiting in the wings, but that Newsom could be a strong candidate in the 2028 primary because of his progressive bona fides and extensive political network.\n- If Biden sticks around, the next Democratic presidential nominee will be chosen through the 2028 primaries. Those are decided by a more liberal subset of the electorate that may be drawn to a candidate like Newsom with a history of bold progressive governance — from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples as mayor of San Francisco in 2004 to [declaring a moratorium on executions](https://calmatters.org/justice/2019/03/gavin-newsom-halts-executions-california/) in California not long after he entered the governor’s office in 2019.\n- Gov.

Gavin Newsom is the talk of the town. But how would he fare on the national stage?\n\n_Lea esta historia en [Español](https://calmatters.org/calmatters-en-espanol/2024/07/california-gobernador-gavin-newsom-presidente-candidato/)_\n\nIn the nearly two weeks since President Joe Biden’s catastrophic performance in a televised debate, the Democratic freakout over whether he can continue as their presumptive presidential nominee has not abated.\n\nEven as Biden insists that he is committed to finishing out the race, speculation continues among the party faithful and political observers over who might be best positioned to defeat Republican former President Donald Trump instead. Among those frequently cited is California’s own Gov. [Gavin Newsom](https://calmatters.org/tag/gavin-newsom/), a dedicated Biden surrogate who recently completed a tour on the president’s behalf through Michigan, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire.\n\nWhile Newsom says he’s standing firmly behind Biden’s re-election and has long publicly denied any presidential ambitions, this chaotic political moment \n\n---\n\n## Source 3: Gavin Newsom's Chances of Being 2028 Nominee Jump in Two Polls in One Week\nURL: https://newsweek.com/gavin-newsom-chances-being-2028-nominee-jump-two-polls-2088447\nPublished: 2025-06-20T15:24:55.000Z\nAuthor: Andrew Stanton\n\n### Summary\nGavin Newsom's prospects for winning the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination have improved significantly, as indicated by two recent polls. Although he has not officially declared his candidacy, he is seen as a strong potential candidate, especially in light of his opposition to President Trump's policies and his active role in responding to recent protests in California. Newsom's confrontations with Trump, particularly regarding the federalization of National Guard troops during the protests, have garnered him national attention and positioned him as a key figure in the Democratic landscape. Other prominent Democrats, such as Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg, may also enter the race, making the primary competitive. Overall, while Newsom's chances appear to be rising, the outcome will depend on various factors, including the dynamics of the primary race and the candidates that emerge.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- [Newsletters](https://www.newsweek.com/preference-center) [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Newsweek) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/newsweek) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/newsweek) [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@newsweek) [Twitter/X](https://x.com/newsweek) [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/newsweek/) [Announcements](https://www.newsweek.com/announcements) California Governor [Gavin Newsom](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/gavin-newsom)'s chances of winning the 2028 Democratic primary increased in a second poll following the Los Angeles protests over President [Donald Trump](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/donald-trump)'s immigration policies.\n- Newsom has not formally said he's planning to run in the primary, which could draw other high profile names including former Vice President [Kamala Harris](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/kamala-harris) and former Transportation Secretary [Pete Buttigieg](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/pete-buttigieg). But he is viewed as a potential candidate by [Democrats](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/democrats). The governor has cast himself as a foil to President Donald Trump following his return to office, and has attracted national attention over his opposition to the president's policies.\n- While Newsom's message may be resonating with Democratic voters, a challenge for him would be to show he is not a \"California liberal\" or \"coastal elite,\" attacks that [Republicans](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/republicans) are likely to throw at him if he becomes the nominee, Danehy said.

His handling of key issues and a strong national profile bolster his candidacy. If he secures the nomination, his choice of running mate will be crucial for uniting the party, particularly against a likely Republican opponent, Vice President JD Vance.\n\nOne potential running mate is Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC), whose progressive appeal and demographic reach could energize the Democratic base. AOC's youth and strong support among younger voters make her an attractive choice, especially after the party's struggles in the 2024 election. However, her polarizing reputation could alienate moderates, posing a risk in swing states.\n\nDespite concerns, AOC has shown adaptability in her political approach, collaborating with Newsom on issues like anti-gerrymandering. If she can align her messaging with Newsom's while maintaining her progressive core, they could form a powerful ticket. The combination of Newsom's experience and AOC's energy could mirror successful historical pairings, potentially maximizing voter enthusiasm and turnout.\n\nIn summary, while Newsom's nomination appears likely, the dynamics of his running mate choice, particularly with AOC, will be critical in shaping his campaign and addressing the challenges the Democratic Party faces moving forward.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- As the faltering Democratic Party looks toward the 2028 presidential election, California Governor Gavin Newsom currently stands as the frontrunner for the party’s nomination, bolstered by his national profile and handling (controversially) of high-stakes issues like immigration and gerrymandering. With polls showing him rising to nearly 25% among Democratic voters (and betting markets like Polymarket now giving him a 20% chance of securing the nomination), Newsom’s trajectory upwards appears strong.\n- Should he clinch the nomination in a little less than 3 years from now, his choice of running mate will be pivotal in uniting a fractured party to counter the Republican field, likely led by Vice President JD Vance. Newsom could select Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) as his vice presidential running mate, leveraging her near-universal name recognition, her progressive energy and demographic appeal.\n- She would need to adapt her public tone to align with his, thereby creating a formidable ticket to reclaim the White House. AOC’s selection would make strategic sense for Newsom, who must balance ideological and demographic dynamics to rebuild the Democratic coalition post-2024 debacle. At 57, Newsom is a seasoned politician with executive experience. However, his California roots and strong of failures invite skepticism in Rust Belt swing states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, where Democrats faltered in 2024.\n\n### Content\n[Home](https://californiaglobe.com/)>[Governor](https://californiaglobe.com/topics/governor/)>Greenberg: Gavin Newsom Could Choose AOC as 2028 Running Mate\n\nA Gavin Newsom/AOC ticket?\n\n27 Sep 20253:30 am\n\nAs the faltering Democratic Party looks toward the 2028 presidential election, California Governor Gavin Newsom currently stands as the frontrunner for the party’s nomination, bolstered by his national profile and handling (controversially) of high-stakes issues like immigration and gerrymandering.

Conducted by co/efficient, the survey found that only 2% of likely voters view Newsom as the face of the Democratic Party. In contrast, 26% of respondents identified New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as the party's leading figure, with the same percentage stating that \"no one\" represents the party. Although Newsom has not officially declared his candidacy, his ability to emerge as a unifying candidate in the post-Trump era is being questioned, especially following the Democratic Party's struggles after the 2024 elections.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Newsom has not said whether he plans to run for the White House, but has long been rumored to be considering a 2028 bid. But Newsom's ability to position himself as a unifying or compelling figure for the post-Trump era could be called into question. Following election losses across the board in 2024, the Democratic Party has gone through infighting and struggled to unify around a clear successor at the top leading for some calls to rally behind a new generation of leadership.\n- [Newsletters](https://www.newsweek.com/preference-center) [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Newsweek) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/newsweek) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/newsweek) [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@newsweek) [Twitter/X](https://x.com/newsweek) [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/newsweek/) [Announcements](https://www.newsweek.com/announcements) A new poll, conducted by co/efficient between May 7 and May 9 among 1,462 likely voters, found that just 2 percent of voters see Newsom as the face of the [Democratic Party](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/democratic-party).

His visibility and support surged following his response to protests in Los Angeles related to Donald Trump's immigration policies, where he positioned himself as a strong opponent to the Trump administration. Newsom's actions, including a lawsuit against the federalization of National Guard troops, have garnered praise from many Democrats. As a result, his support in hypothetical matchups against other candidates has increased since March, indicating a growing favorability among party members.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- [Newsletters](https://www.newsweek.com/preference-center) [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Newsweek) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/newsweek) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/newsweek) [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@newsweek) [Twitter/X](https://x.com/newsweek) [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/newsweek/) [Announcements](https://www.newsweek.com/announcements) California Governor [Gavin Newsom](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/gavin-newsom)'s chances in the 2028 Democratic primary surged in the latest poll after he attracted national attention for his handling of Los Angeles protests over President [Donald Trump](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/donald-trump)'s immigration policy.\n- Still, Newsom's handling of the protests has earned praise from many Democrats, and the latest poll finds that his support against other hypothetical candidates has ticked up since March.

Political analysts indicate that Biden may offer Newsom a prominent role at the Democratic nominating convention to bolster his 2028 aspirations. Despite some concerns within the Democratic Party about Biden's candidacy for 2024, Newsom has publicly supported him, dismissing the idea of an alternative candidate. This relationship could enhance Newsom's visibility and support within the party, potentially increasing his chances for the nomination in 2028. However, the outcome will depend on various factors, including Biden's performance in the 2024 election and the evolving political landscape.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- President Biden could offer California Governor [Gavin Newsom](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/gavin-newsom) \"a high-profile spot at the nominating convention\" to \"tee up his likely 2028 run,\" should Biden win re-election in 2024, according to a leading political scientist. The move is the latest sign in a burgeoning alliance between Biden and Newsom, who previously had a tense relationship, triggering speculation the California governor is being viewed in the White House as a natural successor for 2028.\n- Politics at King's College London, argued the blossoming alliance between Biden and Newsom is mutually beneficial and suggested it could help prepare the California governor for a presidential run in 2028. He commented: \"At this point, Biden is looking to cozy up to just about any prominent Democrat who will go on the record lavishly praising him, including Newsom.\n- Newsom is enthusiastically supporting Biden's re-election campaign, even as some [Democrats](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/democrats) are raising concerns about his candidacy [following a series of gaffes](https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-suffers-two-speech-gaffes-just-over-24-hours-1829155) by the 80-year-old president and some polling putting him [behind Republican front-runner Donald Trump](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-poll-joe-biden-washington-post-1829608).
