## AI Prediction Overview

- AI Prediction: 82%
- Confidence: 76%
- AI Prediction Delta: 9.50%

### Key Factors
- Confirmed September 2025 25 bps cut to 4.00%–4.25% (Sources 2, 3, 4, 6)
- Fed guidance indicating additional 50 bps of easing by year-end or 'two more cuts' after September (Sources 2, 3)
- Softening labor market with inflation above target but not re-accelerating, favoring gradual cuts (Source 3; Source 2 labor market context)
- Committee preference for 25 bps increments; only one dissent favoring 50 bps (Sources 2, 3)
- Limited remaining meetings in 2025 (October and December), making 25 bps in October the cleanest sequencing (Source 6; Fed calendar referenced in market description)

### Outcome Reasoning
(1) Current policy baseline and starting point: The FOMC cut the target federal funds rate by 25 bps at the September 17, 2025 meeting to a 4.00%–4.25% range, as confirmed by the Federal Reserve’s Implementation Note (official) and multiple summaries. This establishes the pre-October level from which the October change will be measured. Sources: Federal Reserve Implementation Note, 2025-09-17 (Source 4); TradingEconomics summary updated October 2025 (Source 2); 1031Crowdfunding recap linking to the Fed press release (Source 3); FedPrimeRate update (Source 6).

(2) Forward guidance pointing to additional easing in 2025: The September projections and post-meeting communications indicated further rate reductions by year-end. TradingEconomics reports the Fed expects another 50 bps of cuts by end-2025 (Source 2). A separate recap noted the Fed signaled “two more cuts this year” after the September move (Source 3). With only two remaining 2025 meetings (October and December per the official calendar referenced in market description and corroborated by Source 6), the most policy-consistent path is 25 bps in October and 25 bps in December, rather than a pause followed by a larger single cut.

(3) Macro context favors gradualism (25 bps) over either no move or 50 bps: The Fed’s September statement acknowledged a softening labor market while inflation remains above target but not re-accelerating, supporting a measured easing pace. Source 3 highlights slower job gains and steady-but-elevated inflation; Source 2 notes sub-100k payroll growth for several months. While Governor Stephen Miran dissented in favor of a 50 bps cut (Source 2/3), the 11-1 vote outcome underscores the Committee’s preference for 25 bps increments absent acute stress. This makes a 25 bps October cut more likely than either a hold or a 50 bps cut.

(4) Policy sequencing and historical behavior: The Fed typically implements policy pivots in 25 bps steps to assess incoming data, especially when inflation is still above target. Given the stated expectation of more easing by year-end (Sources 2–3) and only two meetings left, a 25 bps October step aligns with the Committee’s iterative approach and guidance credibility, reducing the likelihood they skip October and compress the full 50 bps into December.

(5) Ancillary context: Earlier commentary (May 2025) emphasized a patient but easing-biased stance amid uncertainty (Source 1), consistent with gradual cuts later in the year. Although less timely, it aligns with the September pivot toward an easing cycle.

### Confidence Reasoning
(1) Strong, corroborated baseline facts: Multiple credible sources confirm the September 25 bps cut and current 4.00%–4.25% target range, including the Federal Reserve’s official Implementation Note (Source 4) and consistent summaries (Sources 2, 3, 6). This anchors the starting level for the October decision with high reliability.

(2) Convergent guidance on further 2025 easing: Independent summaries of the September projections/communications (Sources 2–3) agree on additional cuts by year-end (50 bps/“two more cuts”), strengthening the signal for an October 25 bps step. While these are secondary sources, they reference the Fed’s official communications and are consistent with market conventions.

(3) Key uncertainties remain: We lack direct linkage to the full September Summary of Economic Projections in the research set and do not have October macro releases (e.g., CPI, jobs) that could sway the decision toward a pause or a larger 50 bps cut. The presence of one 50 bps dissent introduces some upside risk to the cut size if data weaken materially. These factors temper confidence.

(4) Data quality assessment: Official source coverage of the September action is high-quality (Source 4). Forward-looking expectations rely on reputable but secondary summaries (Sources 2–3). Several Grok links are from 2024 and are less relevant now, so they are not weighted. Overall, evidence quality is solid for the baseline and reasonable for the forward path, but timeliness gaps on October data justify less-than-maximal confidence.

Data Quality: MEDIUM

Rodriguez\n\n### Summary\nIn its May 2025 meeting, the Federal Reserve decided to maintain interest rates at 4.25%-4.50%, citing increased uncertainty regarding tariffs and their economic impact. Chair Jay Powell indicated that the Fed would adopt a patient approach, suggesting that any rate cuts would depend on further clarity in economic data, particularly labor market indicators. The Fed anticipates two rate cuts of 25 basis points later this year, with potential adjustments depending on tariff developments. Current forecasts predict a slowdown in U.S. economic growth to below 1% and an increase in inflation, with the core PCE index expected to rise to around 3.4% by the end of 2025. \n\nFor the October 2025 meeting, while the Fed has not made a definitive decision, the current outlook suggests that if economic conditions warrant, a decrease in interest rates could be on the table, particularly if inflation pressures persist or economic growth falters.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- _The U.S. Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady at its May meeting, citing continued uncertainty over the magnitude and persistence of tariffs. However, it signaled that the next move is still likely to be a rate cut later this year._ The Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged today, with the target fed funds rate range holding at 4.25%-4.50%. Officials suggested that, though uncertainty has risen, the economy remains healthy and there is no immediate need to change policy.\n- We anticipate two 25 basis point (bps) rate cuts this year, followed by three cuts in 2026. These forecasts are based on our macroeconomic outlook and a probability-weighted view on the outlook for tariffs. But if tariffs end up higher than our models suggest, the Fed could loosen policy more aggressively (and vice versa). Since the last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) – the 12 central bankers who determine the direction of monetary policy – in March, the economy and financial markets have been buffeted by volatile tariff policy.\n- The updated policy statement said that “uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further” and that “the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen.” In his press conference, Chair Jay Powell emphasized that, given the high level of uncertainty and the positive economic fundamentals, there is no urgency to cut rates in the near-term.\n\n### Content\n[Skip to main content](https://www.nuveen.com/global/insights/investment-outlook/fed-update#mainContent)\n\nTOOLS\n\n- Client portal\n\nLogin to access your documents and resources.\n\nHit enter to search\nClear search\n\n[Investment outlook](https://www.nuveen.com/global/insights/investment-outlook)\n\n# The Fed emphasizes patience over pre-emption\n\n[Tony A.

This marked the first rate cut since December 2024. The Fed anticipates further reductions, projecting a total decrease of 50 basis points by the end of 2025 and an additional quarter point in 2026. Economic forecasts have been adjusted, with GDP growth expectations for 2025 and 2026 revised upward. The unemployment rate is expected to remain at 4.5% for 2025, with a slight decrease to 4.4% for 2026. The next Federal Open Market Committee meeting is scheduled for October 29, 2025, where further decisions on interest rates will be made.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- ## The Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate by 25bps in September 2025, bringing it to the 4.00%–4.25% range, in line with expectations. It is the first reduction in borrowing costs since December. Newly appointed Governor Stephen Miran stood alone in voting against the 25bps move, favoring a half-point cut instead. The central bank also released new economic projections.\n- The unemployment rate continues to be expected at 4.5% for 2025 but was revised lower to 4.4% from 4.5% for next year. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut the federal funds rate by 25bps during its September 2025 meeting, bringing it to the 4.00%–4.25% range — the first reduction in borrowing costs since December. The move comes against the backdrop of a cooling labour market, with payroll growth holding below 100K for four consecutive months.\n- This page provides the latest reported value for - United States Fed Funds Rate - plus previous releases, historical high and low, short-term forecast and long-term prediction, economic calendar, survey consensus and news.

It is the first reduction in borrowing costs since December. Newly appointed Governor Stephen Miran stood alone in voting against the 25bps move, favoring a half-point cut instead. The central bank also released new economic projections. The Fed expects to lower rates by another 50bps by the end of 2025, and a quarter point in 2026, slightly more than expected in June. GDP growth projections were revised higher for 2025 (1.6% vs 1.4% seen in the June projection), 2026 (1.8% vs 1.6%) and 2027 (1.9% vs 1.8%). PCE inflation is seen at 3% for this year, the same as in June but the projection was revised higher for 2026 (2.6% vs 2.4%). Core PCE projection was also left at 3.1% for 2025 but was revised up for 2026 to 2.6% from 2.4%. The unemployment rate continues to be expected at 4.5% for 2025 but was revised lower to 4.4% from 4.5% for next year. source: [Federal Reserve](http://www.federalreserve.gov/)\n\n## The benchmark interest r\n\n---\n\n## Source 3: Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rates for the First Time in 2025\nURL: https://www.1031crowdfunding.com/federal-reserve-cuts-interest-rates-for-the-first-time-in-2025/#:~:text=Yesterday%2C%20the%20U.S.%20Federal%20Reserve,4.25%25%E2%80%934.50%25%20range.\nPublished: 2025-09-18T00:00:00.000Z\nAuthor: Madison Hamby\n\n### Summary\nOn September 17, 2025, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time this year, reducing the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to a target range of 4.00%–4.25%. This decision was influenced by a softening labor market and persistent inflation above the Fed's 2% target, although it has not accelerated unexpectedly. The vote was 11-1, with one governor advocating for a larger cut. The Fed indicated that two more rate cuts may occur later this year, as it aims to balance its dual mandate of managing inflation and supporting employment. Markets will closely monitor upcoming data to see if further cuts align with the Fed's guidance.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Yesterday, [**the U.S. Federal Reserve**](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20250917a.htm) made its first interest rate cut of the year, trimming the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. The new target range is **4.00%–4.25%**, down from the prior 4.25%–4.50% range. - **Labor market softening**: Job growth has clearly slowed, and the unemployment rate has inched up. The Fed pointed to “job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remains low.”\n- - **Inflation still elevated**: While inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target, it has not accelerated unexpectedly, allowing policy makers more room to ease. - The decision passed **11-1**, with **Governor Stephen Miran** dissenting — he preferred a larger, half-point cut. - In its updated projections, the Fed signaled **two more cuts this year**. Fed Chair **Jerome Powell** emphasized that the Fed is watching both halves of its dual mandate carefully: inflation and employment.\n- He noted that downside risks to employment have increased. He also suggested that monetary policy is moving toward a more “neutral” stance as conditions evolve. This rate cut marks a turning point: from a long stretch of holding rates steady to beginning a gradual easing cycle. It reflects growing concern that the labor market may be weakening just enough to tip the balance in favor of lower borrowing costs, even though inflation hasn’t fully settled down.\n\n### Content\n[Register Now](https://www.1031crowdfunding.com/register/) [Login](https://invest.1031crowdfunding.com/login)\n\n# Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rates for the First Time in 2025\n\nBy [Madison Hamby](https://www.1031crowdfunding.com/marketplace-for-1031-exchange-investments/#madison-hamby) \\| September 18, 2025\n\nYesterday, [**the U.S. Federal Reserve**](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20250917a.htm) made its first interest rate cut of the year, trimming the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.

As of the latest update, the target federal funds rate remains at 4.50%, unchanged since July 30, 2025. The next scheduled meeting is on October 29, 2025, where the FOMC will vote on potential changes to this rate.

Traders and analysts will be watching closely for any indications of such a decision during the upcoming meeting. For more details, you can refer to the [Federal Reserve's official site](https://www.federalreserve.gov/).\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members vote on where to set the target interest rate.

The next FOMC meeting, where further decisions regarding interest rates will be made, is scheduled for October 29, 2025.

This establishes the pre-October level from which the October change will be measured. Sources: Federal Reserve Implementation Note, 2025-09-17 (Source 4); TradingEconomics summary updated October 2025 (Source 2); 1031Crowdfunding recap linking to the Fed press release (Source 3); FedPrimeRate update (Source 6).\\n\\n(2) Forward guidance pointing to additional easing in 2025: The September projections and post-meeting communications indicated further rate reductions by year-end. TradingEconomics reports the Fed expects another 50 bps of cuts by end-2025 (Source 2). A separate recap noted the Fed signaled “two more cuts this year” after the September move (Source 3). With only two remaining 2025 meetings (October and December per the official calendar referenced in market description and corroborated by Source 6), the most policy-consistent path is 25 bps in October and 25 bps in December, rather than a pause followed by a larger single cut.\\n\\n(3) Macro context favors gradualism (25 bps) over either no move or 50 bps: The Fed’s September statement acknowledged a softening labor market while inflation remains above target but not re-accelerating, supporting a measured easing pace. Source 3 highlights slower job gains and steady-but-elevated inflation; Source 2 notes sub-100k payroll growth for several months. While Governor Stephen Miran dissented in favor of a 50 bps cut (Source 2/3), the 11-1 vote outcome underscores the Committee’s preference for 25 bps increments absent acute stress. This makes a 25 bps October cut more likely than either a hold or a 50 bps cut.\\n\\n(4) Policy sequencing and historical behavior: The Fed typically implements policy pivots in 25 bps steps to assess incoming data, especially when inflation is still above target. Given the stated expectation of more easing by year-end (Sources 2–3) and only two meetings left, a 25 bps October step aligns with the Committee’s iterative approach and guidance credibility, reducing the likelihood they skip October and compress the full 50 bps into December.\\n\\n(5) Ancillary context: Earlier commentary (May 2025) emphasized a patient but easing-biased stance amid uncertainty (Source 1), consistent with gradual cuts later in the year. Although less timely, it aligns with the September pivot toward an easing cycle.\",\n    \"confidence\": 76,\n    \"confidenceReasoning\": \"(1) Strong, corroborated baseline facts: Multiple credible sources confirm the September 25 bps cut and current 4.00%–4.25% target range, including the Federal Reserve’s official Implementation Note (Source 4) and consistent summaries (Sources 2, 3, 6). This anchors the starting level for the October decision with high reliability.\\n\\n(2) Convergent guidance on further 2025 easing: Independent summaries of the September projections/communications (Sources 2–3) agree on additional cuts by year-end (50 bps/“two more cuts”), strengthening the signal for an October 25 bps step. While these are secondary sources, they reference the Fed’s official communications and are consistent with market conventions.\\n\\n(3) Key uncertainties remain: We lack direct linkage to the full September Summary of Economic Projections in the research set and do not have October macro releases (e.g., CPI, jobs) that could sway the decision toward a pause or a larger 50 bps cut. The presence of one 50 bps dissent introduces some upside risk to the cut size if data weaken materially. These factors temper confidence.\\n\\n(4) Data quality assessment: Official source coverage of the September action is high-quality (Source 4). Forward-looking expectations rely on reputable but secondary summaries (Sources 2–3). Several Grok links are from 2024 and are less relevant now, so they are not weighted.

      "Confirmed September 2025 25 bps cut to 4.00%–4.25% (Sources 2, 3, 4, 6)",
      "Fed guidance indicating additional 50 bps of easing by year-end or 'two more cuts' after September (Sources 2, 3)",

      "Committee preference for 25 bps increments; only one dissent favoring 50 bps (Sources 2, 3)",
      "Limited remaining meetings in 2025 (October and December), making 25 bps in October the cleanest sequencing (Source 6; Fed calendar referenced in market description)"
    ],
    "prediction": {
      "outcome": "YES",
      "confidence": 76,
      "probability": 82,
      "outcomeReasoning": "(1) Current policy baseline and starting point: The FOMC cut the target federal funds rate by 25 bps at the September 17, 2025 meeting to a 4.00%–4.25% range, as confirmed by the Federal Reserve’s Implementation Note (official) and multiple summaries. This establishes the pre-October level from which the October change will be measured. Sources: Federal Reserve Implementation Note, 2025-09-17 (Source 4); TradingEconomics summary updated October 2025 (Source 2); 1031Crowdfunding recap linking to the Fed press release (Source 3); FedPrimeRate update (Source 6).\n\n(2) Forward guidance pointing to additional easing in 2025: The September projections and post-meeting communications indicated further rate reductions by year-end. TradingEconomics reports the Fed expects another 50 bps of cuts by end-2025 (Source 2). A separate recap noted the Fed signaled “two more cuts this year” after the September move (Source 3). With only two remaining 2025 meetings (October and December per the official calendar referenced in market description and corroborated by Source 6), the most policy-consistent path is 25 bps in October and 25 bps in December, rather than a pause followed by a larger single cut.\n\n(3) Macro context favors gradualism (25 bps) over either no move or 50 bps: The Fed’s September statement acknowledged a softening labor market while inflation remains above target but not re-accelerating, supporting a measured easing pace. Source 3 highlights slower job gains and steady-but-elevated inflation; Source 2 notes sub-100k payroll growth for several months. While Governor Stephen Miran dissented in favor of a 50 bps cut (Source 2/3), the 11-1 vote outcome underscores the Committee’s preference for 25 bps increments absent acute stress. This makes a 25 bps October cut more likely than either a hold or a 50 bps cut.\n\n(4) Policy sequencing and historical behavior: The Fed typically implements policy pivots in 25 bps steps to assess incoming data, especially when inflation is still above target. Given the stated expectation of more easing by year-end (Sources 2–3) and only two meetings left, a 25 bps October step aligns with the Committee’s iterative approach and guidance credibility, reducing the likelihood they skip October and compress the full 50 bps into December.\n\n(5) Ancillary context: Earlier commentary (May 2025) emphasized a patient but easing-biased stance amid uncertainty (Source 1), consistent with gradual cuts later in the year. Although less timely, it aligns with the September pivot toward an easing cycle.",
      "confidenceReasoning": "(1) Strong, corroborated baseline facts: Multiple credible sources confirm the September 25 bps cut and current 4.00%–4.25% target range, including the Federal Reserve’s official Implementation Note (Source 4) and consistent summaries (Sources 2, 3, 6). This anchors the starting level for the October decision with high reliability.\n\n(2) Convergent guidance on further 2025 easing: Independent summaries of the September projections/communications (Sources 2–3) agree on additional cuts by year-end (50 bps/“two more cuts”), strengthening the signal for an October 25 bps step. While these are secondary sources, they reference the Fed’s official communications and are consistent with market conventions.\n\n(3) Key uncertainties remain: We lack direct linkage to the full September Summary of Economic Projections in the research set and do not have October macro releases (e.g., CPI, jobs) that could sway the decision toward a pause or a larger 50 bps cut. The presence of one 50 bps dissent introduces some upside risk to the cut size if data weaken materially. These factors temper confidence.\n\n(4) Data quality assessment: Official source coverage of the September action is high-quality (Source 4). Forward-looking expectations rely on reputable but secondary summaries (Sources 2–3). Several Grok links are from 2024 and are less relevant now, so they are not weighted. Overall, evidence quality is solid for the baseline and reasonable for the forward path, but timeliness gaps on October data justify less-than-maximal confidence."

Rodriguez\n\n### Summary\nIn its May 2025 meeting, the Federal Reserve decided to maintain interest rates at 4.25%-4.50%, citing increased uncertainty regarding tariffs and their economic impact. Chair Jay Powell indicated that the Fed would adopt a patient approach, suggesting that any rate cuts would depend on further clarity in economic data, particularly labor market indicators. The Fed anticipates two rate cuts of 25 basis points later this year, with potential adjustments depending on tariff developments. Current forecasts predict a slowdown in U.S. economic growth to below 1% and an increase in inflation, with the core PCE index expected to rise to around 3.4% by the end of 2025. \n\nFor the October 2025 meeting, while the Fed has not made a definitive decision, the current outlook suggests that if economic conditions warrant, a decrease in interest rates could be on the table, particularly if inflation pressures persist or economic growth falters.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- _The U.S. Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady at its May meeting, citing continued uncertainty over the magnitude and persistence of tariffs. However, it signaled that the next move is still likely to be a rate cut later this year._ The Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged today, with the target fed funds rate range holding at 4.25%-4.50%. Officials suggested that, though uncertainty has risen, the economy remains healthy and there is no immediate need to change policy.\n- We anticipate two 25 basis point (bps) rate cuts this year, followed by three cuts in 2026. These forecasts are based on our macroeconomic outlook and a probability-weighted view on the outlook for tariffs. But if tariffs end up higher than our models suggest, the Fed could loosen policy more aggressively (and vice versa). Since the last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) – the 12 central bankers who determine the direction of monetary policy – in March, the economy and financial markets have been buffeted by volatile tariff policy.\n- The updated policy statement said that “uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further” and that “the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen.” In his press conference, Chair Jay Powell emphasized that, given the high level of uncertainty and the positive economic fundamentals, there is no urgency to cut rates in the near-term.\n\n### Content\n[Skip to main content](https://www.nuveen.com/global/insights/investment-outlook/fed-update#mainContent)\n\nTOOLS\n\n- Client portal\n\nLogin to access your documents and resources.\n\nHit enter to search\nClear search\n\n[Investment outlook](https://www.nuveen.com/global/insights/investment-outlook)\n\n# The Fed emphasizes patience over pre-emption\n\n[Tony A.

This marked the first rate cut since December 2024. The Fed anticipates further reductions, projecting a total decrease of 50 basis points by the end of 2025 and an additional quarter point in 2026. Economic forecasts have been adjusted, with GDP growth expectations for 2025 and 2026 revised upward. The unemployment rate is expected to remain at 4.5% for 2025, with a slight decrease to 4.4% for 2026. The next Federal Open Market Committee meeting is scheduled for October 29, 2025, where further decisions on interest rates will be made.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- ## The Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate by 25bps in September 2025, bringing it to the 4.00%–4.25% range, in line with expectations. It is the first reduction in borrowing costs since December. Newly appointed Governor Stephen Miran stood alone in voting against the 25bps move, favoring a half-point cut instead. The central bank also released new economic projections.\n- The unemployment rate continues to be expected at 4.5% for 2025 but was revised lower to 4.4% from 4.5% for next year. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut the federal funds rate by 25bps during its September 2025 meeting, bringing it to the 4.00%–4.25% range — the first reduction in borrowing costs since December. The move comes against the backdrop of a cooling labour market, with payroll growth holding below 100K for four consecutive months.\n- This page provides the latest reported value for - United States Fed Funds Rate - plus previous releases, historical high and low, short-term forecast and long-term prediction, economic calendar, survey consensus and news.

It is the first reduction in borrowing costs since December. Newly appointed Governor Stephen Miran stood alone in voting against the 25bps move, favoring a half-point cut instead. The central bank also released new economic projections. The Fed expects to lower rates by another 50bps by the end of 2025, and a quarter point in 2026, slightly more than expected in June. GDP growth projections were revised higher for 2025 (1.6% vs 1.4% seen in the June projection), 2026 (1.8% vs 1.6%) and 2027 (1.9% vs 1.8%). PCE inflation is seen at 3% for this year, the same as in June but the projection was revised higher for 2026 (2.6% vs 2.4%). Core PCE projection was also left at 3.1% for 2025 but was revised up for 2026 to 2.6% from 2.4%.

This decision was influenced by a softening labor market and persistent inflation above the Fed's 2% target, although it has not accelerated unexpectedly. The vote was 11-1, with one governor advocating for a larger cut. The Fed indicated that two more rate cuts may occur later this year, as it aims to balance its dual mandate of managing inflation and supporting employment. Markets will closely monitor upcoming data to see if further cuts align with the Fed's guidance.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Yesterday, [**the U.S. Federal Reserve**](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20250917a.htm) made its first interest rate cut of the year, trimming the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. The new target range is **4.00%–4.25%**, down from the prior 4.25%–4.50% range. - **Labor market softening**: Job growth has clearly slowed, and the unemployment rate has inched up. The Fed pointed to “job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remains low.”\n- - **Inflation still elevated**: While inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target, it has not accelerated unexpectedly, allowing policy makers more room to ease. - The decision passed **11-1**, with **Governor Stephen Miran** dissenting — he preferred a larger, half-point cut. - In its updated projections, the Fed signaled **two more cuts this year**. Fed Chair **Jerome Powell** emphasized that the Fed is watching both halves of its dual mandate carefully: inflation and employment.\n- He noted that downside risks to employment have increased. He also suggested that monetary policy is moving toward a more “neutral” stance as conditions evolve. This rate cut marks a turning point: from a long stretch of holding rates steady to beginning a gradual easing cycle. It reflects growing concern that the labor market may be weakening just enough to tip the balance in favor of lower borrowing costs, even though inflation hasn’t fully settled down.\n\n### Content\n[Register Now](https://www.1031crowdfunding.com/register/) [Login](https://invest.1031crowdfunding.com/login)\n\n# Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rates for the First Time in 2025\n\nBy [Madison Hamby](https://www.1031crowdfunding.com/marketplace-for-1031-exchange-investments/#madison-hamby) \\| September 18, 2025\n\nYesterday, [**the U.S. Federal Reserve**](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20250917a.htm) made its first interest rate cut of the year, trimming the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.

This establishes the pre-October level from which the October change will be measured. Sources: Federal Reserve Implementation Note, 2025-09-17 (Source 4); TradingEconomics summary updated October 2025 (Source 2); 1031Crowdfunding recap linking to the Fed press release (Source 3); FedPrimeRate update (Source 6).\\n\\n(2) Forward guidance pointing to additional easing in 2025: The September projections and post-meeting communications indicated further rate reductions by year-end. TradingEconomics reports the Fed expects another 50 bps of cuts by end-2025 (Source 2). A separate recap noted the Fed signaled “two more cuts this year” after the September move (Source 3). With only two remaining 2025 meetings (October and December per the official calendar referenced in market description and corroborated by Source 6), the most policy-consistent path is 25 bps in October and 25 bps in December, rather than a pause followed by a larger single cut.\\n\\n(3) Macro context favors gradualism (25 bps) over either no move or 50 bps: The Fed’s September statement acknowledged a softening labor market while inflation remains above target but not re-accelerating, supporting a measured easing pace. Source 3 highlights slower job gains and steady-but-elevated inflation; Source 2 notes sub-100k payroll growth for several months. While Governor Stephen Miran dissented in favor of a 50 bps cut (Source 2/3), the 11-1 vote outcome underscores the Committee’s preference for 25 bps increments absent acute stress. This makes a 25 bps October cut more likely than either a hold or a 50 bps cut.\\n\\n(4) Policy sequencing and historical behavior: The Fed typically implements policy pivots in 25 bps steps to assess incoming data, especially when inflation is still above target. Given the stated expectation of more easing by year-end (Sources 2–3) and only two meetings left, a 25 bps October step aligns with the Committee’s iterative approach and guidance credibility, reducing the likelihood they skip October and compress the full 50 bps into December.\\n\\n(5) Ancillary context: Earlier commentary (May 2025) emphasized a patient but easing-biased stance amid uncertainty (Source 1), consistent with gradual cuts later in the year. Although less timely, it aligns with the September pivot toward an easing cycle.\",\n    \"confidence\": 76,\n    \"confidenceReasoning\": \"(1) Strong, corroborated baseline facts: Multiple credible sources confirm the September 25 bps cut and current 4.00%–4.25% target range, including the Federal Reserve’s official Implementation Note (Source 4) and consistent summaries (Sources 2, 3, 6). This anchors the starting level for the October decision with high reliability.\\n\\n(2) Convergent guidance on further 2025 easing: Independent summaries of the September projections/communications (Sources 2–3) agree on additional cuts by year-end (50 bps/“two more cuts”), strengthening the signal for an October 25 bps step. While these are secondary sources, they reference the Fed’s official communications and are consistent with market conventions.\\n\\n(3) Key uncertainties remain: We lack direct linkage to the full September Summary of Economic Projections in the research set and do not have October macro releases (e.g., CPI, jobs) that could sway the decision toward a pause or a larger 50 bps cut. The presence of one 50 bps dissent introduces some upside risk to the cut size if data weaken materially. These factors temper confidence.\\n\\n(4) Data quality assessment: Official source coverage of the September action is high-quality (Source 4). Forward-looking expectations rely on reputable but secondary summaries (Sources 2–3). Several Grok links are from 2024 and are less relevant now, so they are not weighted. Overall, evidence quality is solid for the baseline and reasonable for the forward path, but timeliness gaps on October data justify less-than-maximal confidence.\",\n    \"probability\": 82\n  },\n  \"keyFactors\": [\n    \"Confirmed September 2025 25 bps cut to 4.00%–4.25% (Sources 2, 3, 4, 6)\",\n    \"Fed guidance indicating additional 50 bps of easing by year-end or 'two more cuts' after September (Sources 2, 3)\",\n    \"Softening labor market with inflation above target but not re-accelerating, favoring gradual cuts (Source 3; Source 2 labor market context)\",\n    \"Committee preference for 25 bps increments; only one dissent favoring 50 bps (Sources 2, 3)\",\n    \"Limited remaining meetings in 2025 (October and December), making 25 bps in October the cleanest sequencing (Source 6; Fed calendar referenced in market description)\"\n  ],\n  \"dataQuality\": \"MEDIUM\",\n  \"lastUpdated\": \"2025-10-13T00:00:00Z\"\n}",

Rodriguez\n\n### Summary\nIn its May 2025 meeting, the Federal Reserve decided to maintain interest rates at 4.25%-4.50%, citing increased uncertainty regarding tariffs and their economic impact. Chair Jay Powell indicated that the Fed would adopt a patient approach, suggesting that any rate cuts would depend on further clarity in economic data, particularly labor market indicators. The Fed anticipates two rate cuts of 25 basis points later this year, with potential adjustments depending on tariff developments. Current forecasts predict a slowdown in U.S. economic growth to below 1% and an increase in inflation, with the core PCE index expected to rise to around 3.4% by the end of 2025. \n\nFor the October 2025 meeting, while the Fed has not made a definitive decision, the current outlook suggests that if economic conditions warrant, a decrease in interest rates could be on the table, particularly if inflation pressures persist or economic growth falters.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- _The U.S. Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady at its May meeting, citing continued uncertainty over the magnitude and persistence of tariffs. However, it signaled that the next move is still likely to be a rate cut later this year._ The Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged today, with the target fed funds rate range holding at 4.25%-4.50%. Officials suggested that, though uncertainty has risen, the economy remains healthy and there is no immediate need to change policy.\n- We anticipate two 25 basis point (bps) rate cuts this year, followed by three cuts in 2026. These forecasts are based on our macroeconomic outlook and a probability-weighted view on the outlook for tariffs. But if tariffs end up higher than our models suggest, the Fed could loosen policy more aggressively (and vice versa). Since the last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) – the 12 central bankers who determine the direction of monetary policy – in March, the economy and financial markets have been buffeted by volatile tariff policy.\n- The updated policy statement said that “uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further” and that “the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen.” In his press conference, Chair Jay Powell emphasized that, given the high level of uncertainty and the positive economic fundamentals, there is no urgency to cut rates in the near-term.\n\n### Content\n[Skip to main content](https://www.nuveen.com/global/insights/investment-outlook/fed-update#mainContent)\n\nTOOLS\n\n- Client portal\n\nLogin to access your documents and resources.\n\nHit enter to search\nClear search\n\n[Investment outlook](https://www.nuveen.com/global/insights/investment-outlook)\n\n# The Fed emphasizes patience over pre-emption\n\n[Tony A.

This marked the first rate cut since December 2024. The Fed anticipates further reductions, projecting a total decrease of 50 basis points by the end of 2025 and an additional quarter point in 2026. Economic forecasts have been adjusted, with GDP growth expectations for 2025 and 2026 revised upward. The unemployment rate is expected to remain at 4.5% for 2025, with a slight decrease to 4.4% for 2026. The next Federal Open Market Committee meeting is scheduled for October 29, 2025, where further decisions on interest rates will be made.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- ## The Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate by 25bps in September 2025, bringing it to the 4.00%–4.25% range, in line with expectations. It is the first reduction in borrowing costs since December. Newly appointed Governor Stephen Miran stood alone in voting against the 25bps move, favoring a half-point cut instead. The central bank also released new economic projections.\n- The unemployment rate continues to be expected at 4.5% for 2025 but was revised lower to 4.4% from 4.5% for next year. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut the federal funds rate by 25bps during its September 2025 meeting, bringing it to the 4.00%–4.25% range — the first reduction in borrowing costs since December. The move comes against the backdrop of a cooling labour market, with payroll growth holding below 100K for four consecutive months.\n- This page provides the latest reported value for - United States Fed Funds Rate - plus previous releases, historical high and low, short-term forecast and long-term prediction, economic calendar, survey consensus and news.

It is the first reduction in borrowing costs since December. Newly appointed Governor Stephen Miran stood alone in voting against the 25bps move, favoring a half-point cut instead. The central bank also released new economic projections. The Fed expects to lower rates by another 50bps by the end of 2025, and a quarter point in 2026, slightly more than expected in June. GDP growth projections were revised higher for 2025 (1.6% vs 1.4% seen in the June projection), 2026 (1.8% vs 1.6%) and 2027 (1.9% vs 1.8%).

This decision was influenced by a softening labor market and persistent inflation above the Fed's 2% target, although it has not accelerated unexpectedly. The vote was 11-1, with one governor advocating for a larger cut. The Fed indicated that two more rate cuts may occur later this year, as it aims to balance its dual mandate of managing inflation and supporting employment. Markets will closely monitor upcoming data to see if further cuts align with the Fed's guidance.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Yesterday, [**the U.S. Federal Reserve**](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20250917a.htm) made its first interest rate cut of the year, trimming the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. The new target range is **4.00%–4.25%**, down from the prior 4.25%–4.50% range. - **Labor market softening**: Job growth has clearly slowed, and the unemployment rate has inched up. The Fed pointed to “job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remains low.”\n- - **Inflation still elevated**: While inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target, it has not accelerated unexpectedly, allowing policy makers more room to ease. - The decision passed **11-1**, with **Governor Stephen Miran** dissenting — he preferred a larger, half-point cut. - In its updated projections, the Fed signaled **two more cuts this year**. Fed Chair **Jerome Powell** emphasized that the Fed is watching both halves of its dual mandate carefully: inflation and employment.\n- He noted that downside risks to employment have increased. He also suggested that monetary policy is moving toward a more “neutral” stance as conditions evolve. This rate cut marks a turning point: from a long stretch of holding rates steady to beginning a gradual easing cycle. It reflects growing concern that the labor market may be weakening just enough to tip the balance in favor of lower borrowing costs, even though inflation hasn’t fully settled down.\n\n### Content\n[Register Now](https://www.1031crowdfunding.com/register/) [Login](https://invest.1031crowdfunding.com/login)\n\n# Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rates for the First Time in 2025\n\nBy [Madison Hamby](https://www.1031crowdfunding.com/marketplace-for-1031-exchange-investments/#madison-hamby) \\| September 18, 2025\n\nYesterday, [**the U.S. Federal Reserve**](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20250917a.htm) made its first interest rate cut of the year, trimming the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.

### Summary
In its May 2025 meeting, the Federal Reserve decided to maintain interest rates at 4.25%-4.50%, citing increased uncertainty regarding tariffs and their economic impact. Chair Jay Powell indicated that the Fed would adopt a patient approach, suggesting that any rate cuts would depend on further clarity in economic data, particularly labor market indicators. The Fed anticipates two rate cuts of 25 basis points later this year, with potential adjustments depending on tariff developments. Current forecasts predict a slowdown in U.S. economic growth to below 1% and an increase in inflation, with the core PCE index expected to rise to around 3.4% by the end of 2025. 

For the October 2025 meeting, while the Fed has not made a definitive decision, the current outlook suggests that if economic conditions warrant, a decrease in interest rates could be on the table, particularly if inflation pressures persist or economic growth falters.

### Key Highlights
- _The U.S. Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady at its May meeting, citing continued uncertainty over the magnitude and persistence of tariffs. However, it signaled that the next move is still likely to be a rate cut later this year._ The Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged today, with the target fed funds rate range holding at 4.25%-4.50%. Officials suggested that, though uncertainty has risen, the economy remains healthy and there is no immediate need to change policy.
- We anticipate two 25 basis point (bps) rate cuts this year, followed by three cuts in 2026. These forecasts are based on our macroeconomic outlook and a probability-weighted view on the outlook for tariffs. But if tariffs end up higher than our models suggest, the Fed could loosen policy more aggressively (and vice versa). Since the last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) – the 12 central bankers who determine the direction of monetary policy – in March, the economy and financial markets have been buffeted by volatile tariff policy.
- The updated policy statement said that “uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further” and that “the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen.” In his press conference, Chair Jay Powell emphasized that, given the high level of uncertainty and the positive economic fundamentals, there is no urgency to cut rates in the near-term.

## The Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate by 25bps in September 2025, bringing it to the 4.00%–4.25% range, in line with expectations. It is the first reduction in borrowing costs since December. Newly appointed Governor Stephen Miran stood alone in voting against the 25bps move, favoring a half-point cut instead. The central bank also released new economic projections. The Fed expects to lower rates by another 50bps by the end of 2025, and a quarter point in 2026, slightly more than expected in June. GDP growth projections were revised higher for 2025 (1.6% vs 1.4% seen in the June projection), 2026 (1.8% vs 1.6%) and 2027 (1.9% vs 1.8%). PCE inflation is seen at 3% for this year, the same as in June but the projection was revised higher for 2026 (2.6% vs 2.4%). Core PCE projection was also left at 3.1% for 2025 but was revised up for 2026 to 2.6% from 2.4%. The unemployment rate continues to be expected at 4.5% for 2025 but was revised lower to 4.4% from 4.5% for next year. source: [Federal Reserve](http://www.federalreserve.gov/)

### Summary
On September 17, 2025, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time this year, reducing the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to a target range of 4.00%–4.25%. This decision was influenced by a softening labor market and persistent inflation above the Fed's 2% target, although it has not accelerated unexpectedly. The vote was 11-1, with one governor advocating for a larger cut. The Fed indicated that two more rate cuts may occur later this year, as it aims to balance its dual mandate of managing inflation and supporting employment. Markets will closely monitor upcoming data to see if further cuts align with the Fed's guidance.

### Key Highlights
- Yesterday, [**the U.S. Federal Reserve**](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20250917a.htm) made its first interest rate cut of the year, trimming the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. The new target range is **4.00%–4.25%**, down from the prior 4.25%–4.50% range. - **Labor market softening**: Job growth has clearly slowed, and the unemployment rate has inched up. The Fed pointed to “job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remains low.”
- - **Inflation still elevated**: While inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target, it has not accelerated unexpectedly, allowing policy makers more room to ease. - The decision passed **11-1**, with **Governor Stephen Miran** dissenting — he preferred a larger, half-point cut. - In its updated projections, the Fed signaled **two more cuts this year**. Fed Chair **Jerome Powell** emphasized that the Fed is watching both halves of its dual mandate carefully: inflation and employment.
- He noted that downside risks to employment have increased. He also suggested that monetary policy is moving toward a more “neutral” stance as conditions evolve. This rate cut marks a turning point: from a long stretch of holding rates steady to beginning a gradual easing cycle. It reflects growing concern that the labor market may be weakening just enough to tip the balance in favor of lower borrowing costs, even though inflation hasn’t fully settled down.

### Summary
The current U.S. Prime Rate is 7.25%, following a decision by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 4.00% - 4.25% on September 17, 2025. The next FOMC meeting, where further decisions regarding interest rates will be made, is scheduled for October 29, 2025.
