### Key Factors
- Twenty-second Amendment bars being elected president more than twice (applies to Trump in 2028)
- Documentation that Trump won in 2016 and 2024, confirming two elections to the office [Source 6]
- Market resolution requires AP/Fox/NBC to call the 2028 race for the same candidate—impossible for Trump given ineligibility
- Republican-leaning 2028 projections do not pertain to Trump personally and cannot override constitutional limits [Source 3]
- Write-in or alternative ballot paths do not circumvent the election-based term limit
- 12th Amendment and eligibility rules further foreclose vice-presidential or line-of-succession workaround for being elected in 2028

### Outcome Reasoning
(1) Constitutional ineligibility for a third election. Donald Trump has already been elected president twice (2016 and 2024). Under the Twenty-second Amendment, "No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice." Simple English Wikipedia explicitly notes Trump cannot run for re-election in 2028 due to term limits and cites the Twenty-second Amendment, with his second term ending January 20, 2029 [Source 4]. This makes a 2028 election win by Trump legally barred.

(2) Confirmation of Trump's 2024 victory, which triggers the term limit. The timeline for the 2028 election documents that major outlets declared Trump the winner of the 2024 presidential election, establishing his second election to the office [Source 6]. With two elections already won (2016 and 2024), the constitutional limit applies directly to 2028.

(3) Market resolution mechanics ensure Trump cannot be the called winner. The market resolves to the candidate called by AP, Fox News, and NBC as the winner of the 2028 election. Because Trump is constitutionally barred from being elected again, these outlets will not call the race for him in 2028. Therefore, this market will not resolve to Trump.

(4) GOP-favoring forecasts do not imply a Trump 2028 win. A by-the-numbers projection suggests a Republican advantage in 2028 (297 EV to 241) [Source 3], but this does not concern Trump specifically. Even if Republicans win, Trump personally cannot win the 2028 election due to term limits.

(5) Outdated speculative commentary is superseded by post-2024 facts. Earlier analyses speculating on a Trump 2028 run (various media in 2023–2024 from the Grok search) predate confirmation of his 2024 win and do not account for the now-binding term limit. Current authoritative references (Wikipedia timeline; Simple English Wikipedia) align on his ineligibility [Sources 4, 6].

- Additional considerations:
  • Ballotpedia affirms the 2028 election date and context but does not contradict the term-limit constraint [Source 2].
  • The Twenty-second Amendment’s bar on being elected applies regardless of ballot method (including write-ins); the 12th Amendment also blocks a twice-elected president from eligibility as vice president. In any case, this market resolves to the 2028 election winner, not post-election succession scenarios.

### Confidence Reasoning
(1) Strong legal basis and clear factual preconditions. The Twenty-second Amendment’s two-election cap is a well-established constitutional rule, and sources provided explicitly apply it to Trump in 2028 [Source 4]. The 2024 victory confirmation in the election timeline [Source 6] fulfills the precondition for term limits, leaving negligible ambiguity about eligibility.

(2) High consistency across sources. Multiple sources align on the 2028 timing and Trump’s status as a two-time winner (2016, 2024) [Sources 4, 6]. While Ballotpedia [Source 2] is general, it does not conflict with the legal constraint, and the GOP-advantage projection [Source 3] is orthogonal to Trump’s personal eligibility.

(3) Residual risk assessment is minimal. The only theoretical paths to a different outcome would involve extraordinary constitutional changes (e.g., repealing the Twenty-second Amendment) or unprecedented legal interpretations before November 2028—events that are extraordinarily unlikely within the timeframe. Moreover, the market resolves to the called election winner by media consensus; succession scenarios would not change the election winner.

(4) Data reliability. Wikipedia pages (including Simple English) are generally reliable for well-established facts and cite primary constitutional constraints; the 2028 timeline corroborates the 2024 outcome. Although no primary legal text is directly linked in the research set, the legal principle is uncontroversial and widely accepted. Overall evidence quality and convergence support a very high-confidence NO.

Data Quality: HIGH

The projection does not account for the actual candidates or voter psychology. As of December 2024, the website projects a Republican victory with 297 electoral votes compared to the Democrat's 241. The Republican candidate is projected to win the popular vote with 49.2% compared to the Democrat's 50.8%. The website also provides state-by-state projections, including the projected vote percentages for each party in each state.\n\n\n### Key Highlights\n- With these results online since 12/16/2024, the AmericanPresidents.net experimental 2028 forecast predicts, to the final popular vote being cast, the results of the upcoming U.S. Presidential Election.

Donald Trump has already been elected president twice (2016 and 2024). Under the Twenty-second Amendment, \\\"No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.\\\" Simple English Wikipedia explicitly notes Trump cannot run for re-election in 2028 due to term limits and cites the Twenty-second Amendment, with his second term ending January 20, 2029 [Source 4]. This makes a 2028 election win by Trump legally barred.\\n\\n(2) Confirmation of Trump's 2024 victory, which triggers the term limit. The timeline for the 2028 election documents that major outlets declared Trump the winner of the 2024 presidential election, establishing his second election to the office [Source 6]. With two elections already won (2016 and 2024), the constitutional limit applies directly to 2028.\\n\\n(3) Market resolution mechanics ensure Trump cannot be the called winner. The market resolves to the candidate called by AP, Fox News, and NBC as the winner of the 2028 election. Because Trump is constitutionally barred from being elected again, these outlets will not call the race for him in 2028. Therefore, this market will not resolve to Trump.\\n\\n(4) GOP-favoring forecasts do not imply a Trump 2028 win. A by-the-numbers projection suggests a Republican advantage in 2028 (297 EV to 241) [Source 3], but this does not concern Trump specifically. Even if Republicans win, Trump personally cannot win the 2028 election due to term limits.\\n\\n(5) Outdated speculative commentary is superseded by post-2024 facts. Earlier analyses speculating on a Trump 2028 run (various media in 2023–2024 from the Grok search) predate confirmation of his 2024 win and do not account for the now-binding term limit. Current authoritative references (Wikipedia timeline; Simple English Wikipedia) align on his ineligibility [Sources 4, 6].\\n\\n- Additional considerations:\\n  • Ballotpedia affirms the 2028 election date and context but does not contradict the term-limit constraint [Source 2].\\n  • The Twenty-second Amendment’s bar on being elected applies regardless of ballot method (including write-ins); the 12th Amendment also blocks a twice-elected president from eligibility as vice president. In any case, this market resolves to the 2028 election winner, not post-election succession scenarios.\",\n    \"confidence\": 98,\n    \"confidenceReasoning\": \"(1) Strong legal basis and clear factual preconditions. The Twenty-second Amendment’s two-election cap is a well-established constitutional rule, and sources provided explicitly apply it to Trump in 2028 [Source 4]. The 2024 victory confirmation in the election timeline [Source 6] fulfills the precondition for term limits, leaving negligible ambiguity about eligibility.\\n\\n(2) High consistency across sources. Multiple sources align on the 2028 timing and Trump’s status as a two-time winner (2016, 2024) [Sources 4, 6]. While Ballotpedia [Source 2] is general, it does not conflict with the legal constraint, and the GOP-advantage projection [Source 3] is orthogonal to Trump’s personal eligibility.\\n\\n(3) Residual risk assessment is minimal. The only theoretical paths to a different outcome would involve extraordinary constitutional changes (e.g., repealing the Twenty-second Amendment) or unprecedented legal interpretations before November 2028—events that are extraordinarily unlikely within the timeframe. Moreover, the market resolves to the called election winner by media consensus; succession scenarios would not change the election winner.\\n\\n(4) Data reliability. Wikipedia pages (including Simple English) are generally reliable for well-established facts and cite primary constitutional constraints; the 2028 timeline corroborates the 2024 outcome. Although no primary legal text is directly linked in the research set, the legal principle is uncontroversial and widely accepted.

    "question": "Will Donald Trump win the 2028 US Presidential Election?",
    "prediction": {
      "outcome": "NO",
      "outcomeReasoning": "(1) Constitutional ineligibility for a third election. Donald Trump has already been elected president twice (2016 and 2024). Under the Twenty-second Amendment, \"No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.\" Simple English Wikipedia explicitly notes Trump cannot run for re-election in 2028 due to term limits and cites the Twenty-second Amendment, with his second term ending January 20, 2029 [Source 4]. This makes a 2028 election win by Trump legally barred.\n\n(2) Confirmation of Trump's 2024 victory, which triggers the term limit. The timeline for the 2028 election documents that major outlets declared Trump the winner of the 2024 presidential election, establishing his second election to the office [Source 6]. With two elections already won (2016 and 2024), the constitutional limit applies directly to 2028.\n\n(3) Market resolution mechanics ensure Trump cannot be the called winner. The market resolves to the candidate called by AP, Fox News, and NBC as the winner of the 2028 election. Because Trump is constitutionally barred from being elected again, these outlets will not call the race for him in 2028. Therefore, this market will not resolve to Trump.\n\n(4) GOP-favoring forecasts do not imply a Trump 2028 win. A by-the-numbers projection suggests a Republican advantage in 2028 (297 EV to 241) [Source 3], but this does not concern Trump specifically. Even if Republicans win, Trump personally cannot win the 2028 election due to term limits.\n\n(5) Outdated speculative commentary is superseded by post-2024 facts. Earlier analyses speculating on a Trump 2028 run (various media in 2023–2024 from the Grok search) predate confirmation of his 2024 win and do not account for the now-binding term limit. Current authoritative references (Wikipedia timeline; Simple English Wikipedia) align on his ineligibility [Sources 4, 6].\n\n- Additional considerations:\n  • Ballotpedia affirms the 2028 election date and context but does not contradict the term-limit constraint [Source 2].\n  • The Twenty-second Amendment’s bar on being elected applies regardless of ballot method (including write-ins); the 12th Amendment also blocks a twice-elected president from eligibility as vice president. In any case, this market resolves to the 2028 election winner, not post-election succession scenarios.",
      "confidence": 98,
      "confidenceReasoning": "(1) Strong legal basis and clear factual preconditions. The Twenty-second Amendment’s two-election cap is a well-established constitutional rule, and sources provided explicitly apply it to Trump in 2028 [Source 4]. The 2024 victory confirmation in the election timeline [Source 6] fulfills the precondition for term limits, leaving negligible ambiguity about eligibility.\n\n(2) High consistency across sources. Multiple sources align on the 2028 timing and Trump’s status as a two-time winner (2016, 2024) [Sources 4, 6]. While Ballotpedia [Source 2] is general, it does not conflict with the legal constraint, and the GOP-advantage projection [Source 3] is orthogonal to Trump’s personal eligibility.\n\n(3) Residual risk assessment is minimal. The only theoretical paths to a different outcome would involve extraordinary constitutional changes (e.g., repealing the Twenty-second Amendment) or unprecedented legal interpretations before November 2028—events that are extraordinarily unlikely within the timeframe. Moreover, the market resolves to the called election winner by media consensus; succession scenarios would not change the election winner.\n\n(4) Data reliability. Wikipedia pages (including Simple English) are generally reliable for well-established facts and cite primary constitutional constraints; the 2028 timeline corroborates the 2024 outcome. Although no primary legal text is directly linked in the research set, the legal principle is uncontroversial and widely accepted. Overall evidence quality and convergence support a very high-confidence NO.",

The Republican candidate is projected to win the popular vote with 49.2% compared to the Democrat's 50.8%.

Donald Trump has already been elected president twice (2016 and 2024). Under the Twenty-second Amendment, \\\"No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.\\\" Simple English Wikipedia explicitly notes Trump cannot run for re-election in 2028 due to term limits and cites the Twenty-second Amendment, with his second term ending January 20, 2029 [Source 4]. This makes a 2028 election win by Trump legally barred.\\n\\n(2) Confirmation of Trump's 2024 victory, which triggers the term limit. The timeline for the 2028 election documents that major outlets declared Trump the winner of the 2024 presidential election, establishing his second election to the office [Source 6]. With two elections already won (2016 and 2024), the constitutional limit applies directly to 2028.\\n\\n(3) Market resolution mechanics ensure Trump cannot be the called winner. The market resolves to the candidate called by AP, Fox News, and NBC as the winner of the 2028 election. Because Trump is constitutionally barred from being elected again, these outlets will not call the race for him in 2028. Therefore, this market will not resolve to Trump.\\n\\n(4) GOP-favoring forecasts do not imply a Trump 2028 win. A by-the-numbers projection suggests a Republican advantage in 2028 (297 EV to 241) [Source 3], but this does not concern Trump specifically. Even if Republicans win, Trump personally cannot win the 2028 election due to term limits.\\n\\n(5) Outdated speculative commentary is superseded by post-2024 facts. Earlier analyses speculating on a Trump 2028 run (various media in 2023–2024 from the Grok search) predate confirmation of his 2024 win and do not account for the now-binding term limit. Current authoritative references (Wikipedia timeline; Simple English Wikipedia) align on his ineligibility [Sources 4, 6].\\n\\n- Additional considerations:\\n  • Ballotpedia affirms the 2028 election date and context but does not contradict the term-limit constraint [Source 2].\\n  • The Twenty-second Amendment’s bar on being elected applies regardless of ballot method (including write-ins); the 12th Amendment also blocks a twice-elected president from eligibility as vice president. In any case, this market resolves to the 2028 election winner, not post-election succession scenarios.\",\n    \"confidence\": 98,\n    \"confidenceReasoning\": \"(1) Strong legal basis and clear factual preconditions. The Twenty-second Amendment’s two-election cap is a well-established constitutional rule, and sources provided explicitly apply it to Trump in 2028 [Source 4]. The 2024 victory confirmation in the election timeline [Source 6] fulfills the precondition for term limits, leaving negligible ambiguity about eligibility.\\n\\n(2) High consistency across sources. Multiple sources align on the 2028 timing and Trump’s status as a two-time winner (2016, 2024) [Sources 4, 6]. While Ballotpedia [Source 2] is general, it does not conflict with the legal constraint, and the GOP-advantage projection [Source 3] is orthogonal to Trump’s personal eligibility.\\n\\n(3) Residual risk assessment is minimal. The only theoretical paths to a different outcome would involve extraordinary constitutional changes (e.g., repealing the Twenty-second Amendment) or unprecedented legal interpretations before November 2028—events that are extraordinarily unlikely within the timeframe. Moreover, the market resolves to the called election winner by media consensus; succession scenarios would not change the election winner.\\n\\n(4) Data reliability. Wikipedia pages (including Simple English) are generally reliable for well-established facts and cite primary constitutional constraints; the 2028 timeline corroborates the 2024 outcome. Although no primary legal text is directly linked in the research set, the legal principle is uncontroversial and widely accepted. Overall evidence quality and convergence support a very high-confidence NO.\",\n    \"probability\": 1\n  },\n  \"keyFactors\": [\n    \"Twenty-second Amendment bars being elected president more than twice (applies to Trump in 2028)\",\n    \"Documentation that Trump won in 2016 and 2024, confirming two elections to the office [Source 6]\",\n    \"Market resolution requires AP/Fox/NBC to call the 2028 race for the same candidate—impossible for Trump given ineligibility\",\n    \"Republican-leaning 2028 projections do not pertain to Trump personally and cannot override constitutional limits [Source 3]\",\n    \"Write-in or alternative ballot paths do not circumvent the election-based term limit\",\n    \"12th Amendment and eligibility rules further foreclose vice-presidential or line-of-succession workaround for being elected in 2028\"\n  ],\n  \"dataQuality\": \"HIGH\",\n  \"lastUpdated\": \"2025-10-09T12:00:00Z\"\n}",

The contract resolves to \"Yes\" for the individual who receives a majority of the Electoral College votes. If no candidate achieves a majority, or if the election doesn't occur, the contract resolves to \"No.\" PredictIt reserves the right to delay settlement and make final decisions regarding any ambiguities. This market will resolve to the person who wins the 2028 US Presidential Election.\n\n\n### Key Highlights\n- The contract that resolves to Yes shall be that which identifies the individual who receives a majority of the votes of the appointed presidential electors when the Electoral College votes are cast in the 2028 United States presidential election. In the event that no person receives such a majority, or that no such election or vote is held, all contracts shall resolve to No.\n- PredictIt reserves the right to wait for further official, party, judicial or other relevant announcements, reports or decisions to resolve any ambiguity or uncertainty before the market is settled. Markets may stay open or incur a delay in settlement well past the date of the contest in certain circumstances. If there is any change to an event, or any situation arises, that is not in PredictIt’s view addressed adequately by the market rules, PredictIt will decide the fairest and most appropriate course of action.\n- PredictIt’s decisions and determinations under this rule shall be at PredictIt’s sole discretion and shall be final.\n\n### Content\nThe contract that resolves to Yes shall be that which identifies the individual who receives a majority of the votes of the appointed presidential electors when the Electoral College votes are cast in the 2028 United States presidential election.

The projection does not account for the actual candidates or voter psychology. As of December 2024, the website projects a Republican victory with 297 electoral votes compared to the Democrat's 241. The Republican candidate is projected to win the popular vote with 49.2% compared to the Democrat's 50.8%.

- PredictIt reserves the right to wait for further official, party, judicial or other relevant announcements, reports or decisions to resolve any ambiguity or uncertainty before the market is settled.

Published: 2024-12-16T00:00:00.000Z

### Summary
This website provides a projection for the 2028 U.S. Presidential Election, based on a "by-the-numbers" approach using data from the 2016, 2020, and 2024 election cycles. The projection does not account for the actual candidates or voter psychology. As of December 2024, the website projects a Republican victory with 297 electoral votes compared to the Democrat's 241. The Republican candidate is projected to win the popular vote with 49.2% compared to the Democrat's 50.8%. The website also provides state-by-state projections, including the projected vote percentages for each party in each state.


### Key Highlights
- With these results online since 12/16/2024, the AmericanPresidents.net experimental 2028 forecast predicts, to the final popular vote being cast, the results of the upcoming U.S. Presidential Election. The projection does not take into account who the actual Republican and Democrat candidates were going to be, instead attempting to define the winner based purely on the numbers behind the vote by state recorded over the last three Presidential Election cycles (2016, 2020, 2024).Note that these results are strictly a by-the-numbers approach without knowing who the candidates for either side are going to be as of December 2024 or what voter psychology will be going into the 2028 election season.
- This allows for a more proportional division of the claimed Electoral Votes. 2) Projections are based on trends observed in each state from the [2016](https://www.americanpresidents.net/2016-election-trump-clinton.php), [2020](https://www.americanpresidents.net/2020-election-trump-biden.php), and [2024](https://www.americanpresidents.net/2024-election-trump-harris.php) presidential election cycles.
