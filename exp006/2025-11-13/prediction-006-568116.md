- AI Prediction Delta: 1.50%

### Key Factors
- Republican control of the House in 2025 makes impeachment passage unlikely absent major intra-party defection (Source 7: Newsweek).
- H.Res.353 exists but remains in committee with no House passage; latest action was a notice of intent for a privileged resolution, not adoption (Sources 1: Congress.gov; 6: GovInfo).
- Market window ends Dec 31, 2026; even a Democratic win in Nov 2026 would not seat a new majority until early 2027, after the window.
- Political signaling suggests the Trump team anticipates any real impeachment risk only if Democrats control the House post-2026 (Source 5: Yahoo summary).
- Historical precedent: prior impeachment attempts required control shifts and/or major scandals; no current evidence of sufficient bipartisan momentum within the timeframe (Source 3: Wikipedia overview).

The bill has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee and is currently in the \"Introduced\" status.

The timeline for this process is set between July 24, 2025, and the end of 2026. Thus, the potential for impeachment exists, but it depends on the legislative actions taken during that period.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- [skip to main content](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov#content)\n\n[Citation](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov#citation)[Subscribe](https://www.congress.gov/get-alerts)[Share/Save](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov#share)[Site Feedback](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov#survey)\n\n# H.Res.353 - Impeaching Donald John Trump, Pre\n\n### Content\n[skip to main content](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov#content)\n\n[Citation](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov#citation)[Subscribe](https://www.congress.gov/get-alerts)[Share/Save](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov#share)[Site Feedback](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov#survey)\n\n# H.Res.353 - Impeaching Donald John Trump, President of the United States, for high crimes and misdemeanors. 119th Congress (2025-2026) \\| [Get alerts](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov)\n\n## Resolution\n\n[Hide Overview](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov)\n\n| Sponsor: | [Rep.

It outlines the constitutional framework for impeachment, which involves a two-stage process: the House of Representatives votes to impeach, and the Senate conducts a trial. The article also reflects on Trump's previous impeachments, highlighting the issues of abuse of power and incitement of insurrection. \n\nFor your specific query regarding whether Trump will be impeached by the end of 2026, the webpage does not provide a definitive answer or prediction. It emphasizes that the outcome depends on political dynamics and actions taken by Congress, particularly the House of Representatives, which would need to vote by a simple majority to approve articles of impeachment.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- 2025 Trump Impeachment \n \n \n The potential impeachment of Donald Trump in 2025 is a topic of interest and speculation, particularly given the controversial nature of his presidency and the unprecedented events that occurred during his time in office.

The first impeachment was primarily focused on allegations of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress related to his dealings with Ukraine. The second impeachment followed the January 6 Capitol riot, with charges of incitement of insurrection. Both impeachments resulted in acquittals by the Senate.\n\nRegarding your query about whether Trump will be impeached by the end of 2026, the page does not provide predictions or future outcomes. However, it does detail the historical context and processes of impeachment, which could inform discussions about potential future actions. For the market resolution you mentioned, it would depend on whether the House of Representatives votes to approve articles of impeachment against Trump during the specified timeframe.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- [Jump to content](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#bodyContent)\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nFor the formal 2019–2020 proceedings, see [Impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_inquiry_into_Donald_Trump), [First impeachment of Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_impeachment_of_Donald_T\n\n### Content\n[Jump to content](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#bodyContent)\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nFor the formal 2019–2020 proceedings, see [Impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_inquiry_into_Donald_Trump), [First impeachment of Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_impeachment_of_Donald_Trump), and [First impeachment trial of Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_impeachment_trial_of_Donald_Trump).\n\nFor the formal 2021 proceedings, see [Second impeachment of Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_impeachment_of_Donald_Trump) and [Second impeachment trial of Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_impeachment_trial_of_Donald_Trump).\n\n| | |\n| --- |\n| This article is part of a series about [Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump) | |\n| --- |\n| Business and personal - [Age and health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_and_health_concerns_about_Donald_Trump) - [Business career](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_career_of_Donald_Trump) - [The Trump Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization) - [wealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump) - [tax returns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_returns_of_Donald_Trump) - [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_in_the_second_Donald_Trump_administration) - [American Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_and_the_American_Civil_War) - [Co\n\n---\n\n## Source 4: What is the likelihood of Donald Trump being impeached after the Democrats take over both chambers of Congress at the 2026 midterm electi...\nURL: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-likelihood-of-Donald-Trump-being-impeached-after-the-Democrats-take-over-both-chambers-of-Congress-at-the-2026-midterm-elections\nPublished: 2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\n\n### Summary\nThe webpage does not provide relevant information regarding the likelihood of Donald Trump being impeached by the end of 2026, particularly in the context of the Democrats taking over both chambers of Congress after the 2026 midterm elections.

Looking back, these are the things I wish I’d done sooner. 1. Your home equity is a gold mine - tap into it instead of getting a loan A lot of people turn to high-interest payday loans when they need cash (please don’t). If you own a home, you might have a much better option: a home equity line of credit ( HELOC). A HELOC lets you borrow against the equity in your house - kind of like a credit card, but with lower interest rates and more flexible repayment terms than most traditional loans. It’s often one of the cheapest ways to borrow money when you really need it. If you’re curious, here’s a calculator to see how much you might be able to get: link here. 2. Compare auto insurance companies every 6-12 months. If you haven’t compared auto insurance offers in the last 6 months, you’re probably overspending (on average by ~$460/year ¹). Example: I finally shopped around and ended up saving ~$1,300 this year by switching carriers for the exact same coverage. It took me about 5 minutes. Seriously, just check a comparison site (I used Coverage.com, but Auto-Savings.com works too). You’ll get multiple offers in one go, and worst case? You stay with what you’ve got. Best case? You save a few hundred bucks a year. Here’s a link to a decent comparison site: link. 3. Stop getting price gouged when you shop online.

Trump's advisers are reportedly considering the likelihood of a third impeachment, following his previous two impeachments. With significant changes already made to U.S. policies, the urgency to push through key legislation, such as extending tax cuts set to expire in 2025, has intensified. The article highlights the stakes of the upcoming midterms, emphasizing that Trump's administration is focused on enacting its agenda before any potential impeachment proceedings could occur.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Return to Homepage](https://www.yahoo.com)\n\n## Top Stories:\n\n- [Senate reaches shutdown deal](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/senators-near-deal-reopen-government-200820963.html)\n- [Flight cancellations](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/thanksgiving-air-traffic-could-slow-163901620.html)\n- [SNAP benefits paused](https://\n\n### Content\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Return to Homepage](https://www.yahoo.com)\n\n## Top Stories:\n\n- [Senate reaches shutdown deal](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/senators-near-deal-reopen-government-200820963.html)\n- [Flight cancellations](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/thanksgiving-air-traffic-could-slow-163901620.html)\n- [SNAP benefits paused](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-administration-tells-states-undo-155333628.html)\n- [Trump talks healthcare](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-urges-lawmakers-healthcare-money-145631423.html)\n- [Abrego Garcia update](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-admin-moves-dissolve-ban-152533849.html)\n- [More flights canceled](https://www.yahoo.com/news/us/live/flights-canceled-at-40-us-airports-full-coverage-as-faa-cuts-to-air-traffic-take-effect-amid-government-shutdown-162954349.html)\n- [NASA's journey to Mars](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/next-mars-launch-window-2026-122601304.html)\n- [A record Arctic blast?](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/early-arctic-cold-snap-could-184000871.html)\n- [Senate works the weekend](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/senators-weekend-shutdown-republicans-democrats-050149827.html)\n- [Full SNAP payments paused](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-admin-asks-supreme-court-235859390.html)\n\nTrump team is already preparing for an impeachment fight in case Dems take control of the House in 2026\n\nMore\n\nYahoo is using AI to generate takeaways from this article.

Given the Republican majority in the House and Senate, the likelihood of impeachment passing is low, but if it were to occur, it could lead to a Senate trial that would disrupt Trump's second term and influence the political landscape leading into the 2026 midterm elections. The Constitution allows for multiple impeachments, raising questions about the grounds for such actions, especially if they are based on policy statements. Thus, while impeachment by the end of 2026 is uncertain, the ongoing political divisions suggest it remains a topic of discussion.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Latest\n[Full List of Democrats Who Voted to End Government Shutdown](https://www.newsweek.com/full-list-of-democrats-who-voted-to-end-government-shutdown-11019295)\n\n- Nation\n\n[News](https://www.newsweek.com/news) [Politics](https://www.newsweek.com/politics) [Tech](https://www.newsweek.com/technology) [Fact Check](https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check) [Person\n\n### Content\nLatest\n[Full List of Democrats Who Voted to End Government Shutdown](https://www.newsweek.com/full-list-of-democrats-who-voted-to-end-government-shutdown-11019295)\n\n- Nation\n\n[News](https://www.newsweek.com/news) [Politics](https://www.newsweek.com/politics) [Tech](https://www.newsweek.com/technology) [Fact Check](https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check) [Personal Finance](https://www.newsweek.com/personal-finance) [Automotive](https://www.newsweek.com/autos) [Sports](https://www.newsweek.com/sports) [Better Workplaces](https://www.newsweek.com/better-workplaces)\n\n- World\n\n[Russia-Ukraine](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/russia) [Middle East](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/middle-east) [China And Asia](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/china) [Better Planet](https://www.newsweek.com/better-planet) [All World News](https://www.newsweek.com/world)\n\n- Lifestyle\n\n[Family & Parenting](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/parenting) [Entertainment](https://www.newsweek.com/entertainment) [Travel](https://www.newsweek.com/travel) [Pets](https://www.newsweek.com/pets) [Relationships](https://www.newsweek.com/relationships) [Science](https://www.newsweek.com/tech-science) [Health](https://www.newsweek.com/health)\n\n- Opinion\n\n[My Turn](https://www.newsweek.com/my-turn) [All Opinion](https://www.newsweek.com/opinion)\n\n- Rankings\n\n[Health](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/health) [Finance](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/finance) [Products](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/products-\n\n---\n\n## Source 8: Impeach Trump 2025\nURL: https://csr.cs.uml.edu/impeach-trump-2025\nPublished: 2025-03-31T00:00:00.000Z\nAuthor: Ashley\n\n### Summary\nThe article discusses the potential for a second impeachment of former President Donald Trump in 2025, considering the political and legal landscape at that time. It highlights that the context of a second impeachment would differ from the first, which focused on abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Key factors that could lead to impeachment include controversial policy decisions, allegations of financial misconduct, and foreign policy controversies. For example, actions such as restricting reproductive healthcare access or engaging in financial corruption could provoke calls for impeachment.

This article delves into the implications and possibilities of such an event occurring once again in 2025, exploring the political landscape, legal intricacies, and potential outcomes. \n The Context of a Second Impeachment The year 2025 marks a significant juncture in American political history, as it coincides with the potential end of a second term for President Trump or the start of a new administration, should he be unseated. The idea of a second impeachment gains traction amidst the ongoing discussions and debates surrounding the legacy of the 45th President and the impact of his policies and actions on the nation. \n While the first impeachment trial, which occurred in early 2020, focused primarily on allegations of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, the prospect of a second impeachment would likely revolve around a different set of circumstances and charges. The specific events and actions leading up to such a scenario are impossible to predict with certainty, but several potential factors could contribute to a second impeachment effort. \n The Impact of Policy Decisions \n One key aspect that could trigger a renewed call for impeachment is the potential for controversial policy decisions made by President Trump during his second term.\n\n---\n\n# Grok Web Search Results\n\nThe following search results provide additional real-time context:\n\n## Result 1: Experts Weigh in on Potential Trump Impeachment by 2026\nURL: https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/15/politics/trump-impeachment-prospects/\nSource: CNN\nPublished: 2023-09-15T14:30:00Z\n\nPolitical analysts discuss the likelihood of Donald Trump facing impeachment if he returns to the presidency in 2025.

Newsweek reports Republicans hold the House and Senate in 2025, making passage of impeachment articles improbable under current control (Source 7: Newsweek, 2025-02-06). Even if Democrats were to win the House in November 2026, the new majority would not be seated until early 2027, outside the market’s window ending December 31, 2026. Thus, the decisive period (July 24, 2025–Dec 31, 2026) is dominated by a House unlikely to impeach a president of its own party.\\n\\n(2) Existing impeachment efforts have not advanced to a floor vote. H.Res.353 (Thanedar) to impeach President Trump was introduced April 28, 2025, and referred to the Judiciary Committee; the latest action records a notice of intent to offer a privileged resolution, but no House passage (Source 1: Congress.gov; Source 6: GovInfo). Under a GOP majority, such resolutions are typically tabled or bottled in committee rather than adopted. No credible reporting shows movement to a majority vote approving articles within the specified period.\\n\\n(3) Public and political signals point to low probability before 2027. Coverage notes the Trump team preparing for a potential impeachment only if Democrats take the House in 2026—implicitly acknowledging that impeachment is not expected under current control and that any meaningful effort would come after seating of the next Congress (Source 5: Yahoo summary, 2025-04-29). Background summaries catalog ongoing efforts but do not indicate imminent House approval (Source 3: Wikipedia overview as of 2025-11-08). Given the market requires only a House majority vote, the path would require a large GOP defection or bipartisan shock event before end-2026—historically rare and unsupported by current evidence.\\n\\n- Key procedural fact pattern:\\n  • Market window: July 24, 2025–Dec 31, 2026 (market description)\\n  • Current impeachment vehicle: H.Res.353 in committee; no passage (Sources 1, 6)\\n  • Political environment: GOP House control in 2025; impeachment unlikely without majority-party support (Source 7)\\n  • 2026 midterms: Even if Democrats win, the new House seats in early 2027, beyond market window (general congressional calendar; reflected in Source 5’s framing that focus is post-2026 control)\\n\\n- Taken together, the absence of floor action, majority-party incentives, and the calendar constraint strongly favor a NO resolution by end-2026.\",\n  \"confidence\": 75,\n  \"confidenceReasoning\": \"(1) Strong primary-source confirmation of legislative status. Congress.gov and GovInfo provide authoritative, up-to-date records that H.Res.353 exists but has not advanced to passage (Sources 1, 6). This directly bears on the market’s requirement of a House majority vote and supports a low likelihood through 2026.\\n\\n(2) Consistent cross-source political context. Newsweek explicitly notes Republican control in 2025, implying low odds of impeachment under current leadership (Source 7). The Yahoo summary frames impeachment planning around a potential post-2026 Democratic House, reinforcing that meaningful action is expected after, not before, the market window (Source 5). Wikipedia adds neutral historical context and references ongoing attempts without evidence of imminent passage (Source 3).\\n\\n(3) Caveats and data gaps. Some supporting links (e.g., 2023 analyses in Grok search results) are dated and speculative relative to current Congress composition, and one source (Quora) is irrelevant/low quality (Source 4). We do not have an explicit, official House roster source in this dataset, relying instead on reputable secondary reporting (Newsweek) for control context. These limitations modestly reduce confidence but do not materially alter the conclusion given the procedural posture and calendar.\\n\\n- Overall, primary legislative records + credible media context justify above-average confidence, tempered by limited granularity on House margins and reliance on secondary reporting for chamber control.\",\n  \"probability\": 10,\n  \"keyFactors\": [\n    \"Republican control of the House in 2025 makes impeachment passage unlikely absent major intra-party defection (Source 7: Newsweek).\",\n    \"H.Res.353 exists but remains in committee with no House passage; latest action was a notice of intent for a privileged resolution, not adoption (Sources 1: Congress.gov; 6: GovInfo).\",\n    \"Market window ends Dec 31, 2026; even a Democratic win in Nov 2026 would not seat a new majority until early 2027, after the window.\",\n    \"Political signaling suggests the Trump team anticipates any real impeachment risk only if Democrats control the House post-2026 (Source 5: Yahoo summary).\",\n    \"Historical precedent: prior impeachment attempts required control shifts and/or major scandals; no current evidence of sufficient bipartisan momentum within the timeframe (Source 3: Wikipedia overview).\"\n  ],\n  \"dataQuality\": 68,\n  \"lastUpdated\": \"2025-11-13T00:00:00Z\"\n}",

The Grok web search results are from 2023 and provide generic analysis that's not particularly relevant now. They noted that control of the House is key. We should decide on the predicted outcome. The market indicates there's an 8.5% chance that Trump will be impeached by the end of 2026, given some evidence surrounding H.Res.353 introduced in April 2025.**Analyzing impeachment scenarios**\n\nIf Democrats retake the House in November 2026, the new Congress won’t be seated until January 2027, while the market window closes on December 31, 2026. Therefore, impeachment would need a House vote before the end of 2026, but the House composition remains until January 3, 2027. This means that a potential Democratic win doesn’t help for the market timeframe. It's essential to note that Republicans are unlikely to impeach Trump unless a significant bipartisan wave occurs to influence them. However, such a scenario feels improbable.**Exploring impeachment resolutions**\n\nThe sponsor might try to force a floor consideration as a privileged resolution, but the majority can simply table it. Historically, Democrats have introduced impeachment resolutions, while Republicans, like Green, have used privileged resolutions to table votes under Pelosi. The GOP could potentially table or refer it to the Judiciary Committee, which appears to be their recent action. The timeframe for this is between July 24, 2025, and December 31, 2026. However, the resolution likely won't make it to a vote if the majority chooses not to. Also, Newsweek mentions Rep. Al Green in impeachment discussions.**Assessing impeachment probabilities**\n\nCould he offer a privileged resolution? It’s likely that the GOP majority would table it. If the Senate majority doesn't matter, we have to focus on the House. The Yahoo article suggests Trump’s team is preparing for impeachment if Democrats take the House in 2026. However, that new House won’t convene until 2027, after the market closes. Given this timeline, I think the outcome for impeachment is likely “no,” with a probability of around 8-12% for “yes.” A significant scandal might be the only plausible path, but even then, it feels under 10%. I might estimate it at 10%, with about 70-80% confidence.**Evaluating impeachment context**\n\nWe have good context for understanding House control, but we lack definitive seat counts. Newsweek indicates GOP majorities in both chambers. The time window is also crucial here, and I feel about 75% confident in this assessment. The data quality appears moderate, with some sources being low quality, like Quora and generic 2023 analyses. I think a score of 68 is reasonable. Additionally, I need to cite relevant sources for the outcome reasoning and include factors that highlight the importance of the House schedule and impeachment processes. The new Congress will indeed be seated in January following elections, as usual, but I should avoid unsupported statements. Also, H.Res.353 is currently in committee without action to move it to the floor.",

## Full Prediction Data

{
  "marketId": "568116",
  "prediction": {
    "outcome": "NO",
    "outcomeReasoning": "(1) House control and timing make a 2025–2026 impeachment highly unlikely. Newsweek reports Republicans hold the House and Senate in 2025, making passage of impeachment articles improbable under current control (Source 7: Newsweek, 2025-02-06). Even if Democrats were to win the House in November 2026, the new majority would not be seated until early 2027, outside the market’s window ending December 31, 2026. Thus, the decisive period (July 24, 2025–Dec 31, 2026) is dominated by a House unlikely to impeach a president of its own party.\n\n(2) Existing impeachment efforts have not advanced to a floor vote. H.Res.353 (Thanedar) to impeach President Trump was introduced April 28, 2025, and referred to the Judiciary Committee; the latest action records a notice of intent to offer a privileged resolution, but no House passage (Source 1: Congress.gov; Source 6: GovInfo). Under a GOP majority, such resolutions are typically tabled or bottled in committee rather than adopted. No credible reporting shows movement to a majority vote approving articles within the specified period.\n\n(3) Public and political signals point to low probability before 2027. Coverage notes the Trump team preparing for a potential impeachment only if Democrats take the House in 2026—implicitly acknowledging that impeachment is not expected under current control and that any meaningful effort would come after seating of the next Congress (Source 5: Yahoo summary, 2025-04-29). Background summaries catalog ongoing efforts but do not indicate imminent House approval (Source 3: Wikipedia overview as of 2025-11-08). Given the market requires only a House majority vote, the path would require a large GOP defection or bipartisan shock event before end-2026—historically rare and unsupported by current evidence.\n\n- Key procedural fact pattern:\n  • Market window: July 24, 2025–Dec 31, 2026 (market description)\n  • Current impeachment vehicle: H.Res.353 in committee; no passage (Sources 1, 6)\n  • Political environment: GOP House control in 2025; impeachment unlikely without majority-party support (Source 7)\n  • 2026 midterms: Even if Democrats win, the new House seats in early 2027, beyond market window (general congressional calendar; reflected in Source 5’s framing that focus is post-2026 control)\n\n- Taken together, the absence of floor action, majority-party incentives, and the calendar constraint strongly favor a NO resolution by end-2026.",

Congress.gov and GovInfo provide authoritative, up-to-date records that H.Res.353 exists but has not advanced to passage (Sources 1, 6). This directly bears on the market’s requirement of a House majority vote and supports a low likelihood through 2026.\n\n(2) Consistent cross-source political context. Newsweek explicitly notes Republican control in 2025, implying low odds of impeachment under current leadership (Source 7). The Yahoo summary frames impeachment planning around a potential post-2026 Democratic House, reinforcing that meaningful action is expected after, not before, the market window (Source 5). Wikipedia adds neutral historical context and references ongoing attempts without evidence of imminent passage (Source 3).\n\n(3) Caveats and data gaps. Some supporting links (e.g., 2023 analyses in Grok search results) are dated and speculative relative to current Congress composition, and one source (Quora) is irrelevant/low quality (Source 4). We do not have an explicit, official House roster source in this dataset, relying instead on reputable secondary reporting (Newsweek) for control context. These limitations modestly reduce confidence but do not materially alter the conclusion given the procedural posture and calendar.\n\n- Overall, primary legislative records + credible media context justify above-average confidence, tempered by limited granularity on House margins and reliance on secondary reporting for chamber control.",

The bill has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee and is currently in the \"Introduced\" status. The articles of impeachment include allegations of obstruction of justice, violation of due process, and failure to faithfully execute laws. \n\nFor your query regarding whether Trump will be impeached by the end of 2026, the resolution must pass through the House of Representatives with a simple majority vote. The timeline for this process is set between July 24, 2025, and the end of 2026.

The first impeachment was primarily focused on allegations of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress related to his dealings with Ukraine. The second impeachment followed the January 6 Capitol riot, with charges of incitement of insurrection. Both impeachments resulted in acquittals by the Senate.\n\nRegarding your query about whether Trump will be impeached by the end of 2026, the page does not provide predictions or future outcomes. However, it does detail the historical context and processes of impeachment, which could inform discussions about potential future actions.

Looking back, these are the things I wish I’d done sooner. 1. Your home equity is a gold mine - tap into it instead of getting a loan A lot of people turn to high-interest payday loans when they need cash (please don’t). If you own a home, you might have a much better option: a home equity line of credit ( HELOC). A HELOC lets you borrow against the equity in your house - kind of like a credit card, but with lower interest rates and more flexible repayment terms than most traditional loans. It’s often one of the cheapest ways to borrow money when you really need it. If you’re curious, here’s a calculator to see how much you might be able to get: link here. 2. Compare auto insurance companies every 6-12 months. If you haven’t compared auto insurance offers in the last 6 months, you’re probably overspending (on average by ~$460/year ¹). Example: I finally shopped around and ended up saving ~$1,300 this year by switching carriers for the exact same coverage. It took me about 5 minutes. Seriously, just check a comparison site (I used Coverage.com, but Auto-Savings.com works too). You’ll get multiple offers in one go, and worst case? You stay with what you’ve got. Best case? You save a few hundred bucks a year. Here’s a link to a decent comparison site: link. 3. Stop getting price gouged when you shop online.

Trump's advisers are reportedly considering the likelihood of a third impeachment, following his previous two impeachments. With significant changes already made to U.S. policies, the urgency to push through key legislation, such as extending tax cuts set to expire in 2025, has intensified. The article highlights the stakes of the upcoming midterms, emphasizing that Trump's administration is focused on enacting its agenda before any potential impeachment proceedings could occur.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Return to Homepage](https://www.yahoo.com)\n\n## Top Stories:\n\n- [Senate reaches shutdown deal](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/senators-near-deal-reopen-government-200820963.html)\n- [Flight cancellations](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/thanksgiving-air-traffic-could-slow-163901620.html)\n- [SNAP benefits paused](https://\n\n### Content\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Return to Homepage](https://www.yahoo.com)\n\n## Top Stories:\n\n- [Senate reaches shutdown deal](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/senators-near-deal-reopen-government-200820963.html)\n- [Flight cancellations](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/thanksgiving-air-traffic-could-slow-163901620.html)\n- [SNAP benefits paused](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-administration-tells-states-undo-155333628.html)\n- [Trump talks healthcare](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-urges-lawmakers-healthcare-money-145631423.html)\n- [Abrego Garcia update](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-admin-moves-dissolve-ban-152533849.html)\n- [More flights canceled](https://www.yahoo.com/news/us/live/flights-canceled-at-40-us-airports-full-coverage-as-faa-cuts-to-air-traffic-take-effect-amid-government-shutdown-162954349.html)\n- [NASA's journey to Mars](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/next-mars-launch-window-2026-122601304.html)\n- [A record Arctic blast?](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/early-arctic-cold-snap-could-184000871.html)\n- [Senate works the weekend](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/senators-weekend-shutdown-republicans-democrats-050149827.html)\n- [Full SNAP payments paused](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-admin-asks-supreme-court-235859390.html)\n\nTrump team is already preparing for an impeachment fight in case Dems take control of the House in 2026\n\nMore\n\nYahoo is using AI to generate takeaways from this article.

Given the Republican majority in the House and Senate, the likelihood of impeachment passing is low, but if it were to occur, it could lead to a Senate trial that would disrupt Trump's second term and influence the political landscape leading into the 2026 midterm elections. The Constitution allows for multiple impeachments, raising questions about the grounds for such actions, especially if they are based on policy statements. Thus, while impeachment by the end of 2026 is uncertain, the ongoing political divisions suggest it remains a topic of discussion.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Latest\n[Full List of Democrats Who Voted to End Government Shutdown](https://www.newsweek.com/full-list-of-democrats-who-voted-to-end-government-shutdown-11019295)\n\n- Nation\n\n[News](https://www.newsweek.com/news) [Politics](https://www.newsweek.com/politics) [Tech](https://www.newsweek.com/technology) [Fact Check](https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check) [Person\n\n### Content\nLatest\n[Full List of Democrats Who Voted to End Government Shutdown](https://www.newsweek.com/full-list-of-democrats-who-voted-to-end-government-shutdown-11019295)\n\n- Nation\n\n[News](https://www.newsweek.com/news) [Politics](https://www.newsweek.com/politics) [Tech](https://www.newsweek.com/technology) [Fact Check](https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check) [Personal Finance](https://www.newsweek.com/personal-finance) [Automotive](https://www.newsweek.com/autos) [Sports](https://www.newsweek.com/sports) [Better Workplaces](https://www.newsweek.com/better-workplaces)\n\n- World\n\n[Russia-Ukraine](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/russia) [Middle East](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/middle-east) [China And Asia](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/china) [Better Planet](https://www.newsweek.com/better-planet) [All World News](https://www.newsweek.com/world)\n\n- Lifestyle\n\n[Family & Parenting](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/parenting) [Entertainment](https://www.newsweek.com/entertainment) [Travel](https://www.newsweek.com/travel) [Pets](https://www.newsweek.com/pets) [Relationships](https://www.newsweek.com/relationships) [Science](https://www.newsweek.com/tech-science) [Health](https://www.newsweek.com/health)\n\n- Opinion\n\n[My Turn](https://www.newsweek.com/my-turn) [All Opinion](https://www.newsweek.com/opinion)\n\n- Rankings\n\n[Health](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/health) [Finance](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/finance) [Products](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/products-\n\n---\n\n## Source 8: Impeach Trump 2025\nURL: https://csr.cs.uml.edu/impeach-trump-2025\nPublished: 2025-03-31T00:00:00.000Z\nAuthor: Ashley\n\n### Summary\nThe article discusses the potential for a second impeachment of former President Donald Trump in 2025, considering the political and legal landscape at that time. It highlights that the context of a second impeachment would differ from the first, which focused on abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Key factors that could lead to impeachment include controversial policy decisions, allegations of financial misconduct, and foreign policy controversies.

This article delves into the implications and possibilities of such an event occurring once again in 2025, exploring the political landscape, legal intricacies, and potential outcomes. \n The Context of a Second Impeachment The year 2025 marks a significant juncture in American political history, as it coincides with the potential end of a second term for President Trump or the start of a new administration, should he be unseated. The idea of a second impeachment gains traction amidst the ongoing discussions and debates surrounding the legacy of the 45th President and the impact of his policies and actions on the nation. \n While the first impeachment trial, which occurred in early 2020, focused primarily on allegations of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, the prospect of a second impeachment would likely revolve around a different set of circumstances and charges. The specific events and actions leading up to such a scenario are impossible to predict with certainty, but several potential factors could contribute to a second impeachment effort. \n The Impact of Policy Decisions \n One key aspect that could trigger a renewed call for impeachment is the potential for controversial policy decisions made by President Trump during his second term.\n\n---\n\n# Grok Web Search Results\n\nThe following search results provide additional real-time context:\n\n## Result 1: Experts Weigh in on Potential Trump Impeachment by 2026\nURL: https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/15/politics/trump-impeachment-prospects/\nSource: CNN\nPublished: 2023-09-15T14:30:00Z\n\nPolitical analysts discuss the likelihood of Donald Trump facing impeachment if he returns to the presidency in 2025.

Newsweek reports Republicans hold the House and Senate in 2025, making passage of impeachment articles improbable under current control (Source 7: Newsweek, 2025-02-06). Even if Democrats were to win the House in November 2026, the new majority would not be seated until early 2027, outside the market’s window ending December 31, 2026. Thus, the decisive period (July 24, 2025–Dec 31, 2026) is dominated by a House unlikely to impeach a president of its own party.\\n\\n(2) Existing impeachment efforts have not advanced to a floor vote. H.Res.353 (Thanedar) to impeach President Trump was introduced April 28, 2025, and referred to the Judiciary Committee; the latest action records a notice of intent to offer a privileged resolution, but no House passage (Source 1: Congress.gov; Source 6: GovInfo). Under a GOP majority, such resolutions are typically tabled or bottled in committee rather than adopted. No credible reporting shows movement to a majority vote approving articles within the specified period.\\n\\n(3) Public and political signals point to low probability before 2027. Coverage notes the Trump team preparing for a potential impeachment only if Democrats take the House in 2026—implicitly acknowledging that impeachment is not expected under current control and that any meaningful effort would come after seating of the next Congress (Source 5: Yahoo summary, 2025-04-29). Background summaries catalog ongoing efforts but do not indicate imminent House approval (Source 3: Wikipedia overview as of 2025-11-08). Given the market requires only a House majority vote, the path would require a large GOP defection or bipartisan shock event before end-2026—historically rare and unsupported by current evidence.\\n\\n- Key procedural fact pattern:\\n  • Market window: July 24, 2025–Dec 31, 2026 (market description)\\n  • Current impeachment vehicle: H.Res.353 in committee; no passage (Sources 1, 6)\\n  • Political environment: GOP House control in 2025; impeachment unlikely without majority-party support (Source 7)\\n  • 2026 midterms: Even if Democrats win, the new House seats in early 2027, beyond market window (general congressional calendar; reflected in Source 5’s framing that focus is post-2026 control)\\n\\n- Taken together, the absence of floor action, majority-party incentives, and the calendar constraint strongly favor a NO resolution by end-2026.\",\n  \"confidence\": 75,\n  \"confidenceReasoning\": \"(1) Strong primary-source confirmation of legislative status. Congress.gov and GovInfo provide authoritative, up-to-date records that H.Res.353 exists but has not advanced to passage (Sources 1, 6). This directly bears on the market’s requirement of a House majority vote and supports a low likelihood through 2026.\\n\\n(2) Consistent cross-source political context. Newsweek explicitly notes Republican control in 2025, implying low odds of impeachment under current leadership (Source 7). The Yahoo summary frames impeachment planning around a potential post-2026 Democratic House, reinforcing that meaningful action is expected after, not before, the market window (Source 5). Wikipedia adds neutral historical context and references ongoing attempts without evidence of imminent passage (Source 3).\\n\\n(3) Caveats and data gaps. Some supporting links (e.g., 2023 analyses in Grok search results) are dated and speculative relative to current Congress composition, and one source (Quora) is irrelevant/low quality (Source 4). We do not have an explicit, official House roster source in this dataset, relying instead on reputable secondary reporting (Newsweek) for control context. These limitations modestly reduce confidence but do not materially alter the conclusion given the procedural posture and calendar.\\n\\n- Overall, primary legislative records + credible media context justify above-average confidence, tempered by limited granularity on House margins and reliance on secondary reporting for chamber control.\",\n  \"probability\": 10,\n  \"keyFactors\": [\n    \"Republican control of the House in 2025 makes impeachment passage unlikely absent major intra-party defection (Source 7: Newsweek).\",\n    \"H.Res.353 exists but remains in committee with no House passage; latest action was a notice of intent for a privileged resolution, not adoption (Sources 1: Congress.gov; 6: GovInfo).\",\n    \"Market window ends Dec 31, 2026; even a Democratic win in Nov 2026 would not seat a new majority until early 2027, after the window.\",\n    \"Political signaling suggests the Trump team anticipates any real impeachment risk only if Democrats control the House post-2026 (Source 5: Yahoo summary).\",\n    \"Historical precedent: prior impeachment attempts required control shifts and/or major scandals; no current evidence of sufficient bipartisan momentum within the timeframe (Source 3: Wikipedia overview).\"\n  ],\n  \"dataQuality\": 68,\n  \"lastUpdated\": \"2025-11-13T00:00:00Z\"\n}",

The Grok web search results are from 2023 and provide generic analysis that's not particularly relevant now. They noted that control of the House is key. We should decide on the predicted outcome. The market indicates there's an 8.5% chance that Trump will be impeached by the end of 2026, given some evidence surrounding H.Res.353 introduced in April 2025.**Analyzing impeachment scenarios**\n\nIf Democrats retake the House in November 2026, the new Congress won’t be seated until January 2027, while the market window closes on December 31, 2026. Therefore, impeachment would need a House vote before the end of 2026, but the House composition remains until January 3, 2027. This means that a potential Democratic win doesn’t help for the market timeframe. It's essential to note that Republicans are unlikely to impeach Trump unless a significant bipartisan wave occurs to influence them. However, such a scenario feels improbable.**Exploring impeachment resolutions**\n\nThe sponsor might try to force a floor consideration as a privileged resolution, but the majority can simply table it. Historically, Democrats have introduced impeachment resolutions, while Republicans, like Green, have used privileged resolutions to table votes under Pelosi. The GOP could potentially table or refer it to the Judiciary Committee, which appears to be their recent action. The timeframe for this is between July 24, 2025, and December 31, 2026. However, the resolution likely won't make it to a vote if the majority chooses not to. Also, Newsweek mentions Rep. Al Green in impeachment discussions.**Assessing impeachment probabilities**\n\nCould he offer a privileged resolution? It’s likely that the GOP majority would table it. If the Senate majority doesn't matter, we have to focus on the House. The Yahoo article suggests Trump’s team is preparing for impeachment if Democrats take the House in 2026. However, that new House won’t convene until 2027, after the market closes. Given this timeline, I think the outcome for impeachment is likely “no,” with a probability of around 8-12% for “yes.” A significant scandal might be the only plausible path, but even then, it feels under 10%. I might estimate it at 10%, with about 70-80% confidence.**Evaluating impeachment context**\n\nWe have good context for understanding House control, but we lack definitive seat counts. Newsweek indicates GOP majorities in both chambers. The time window is also crucial here, and I feel about 75% confident in this assessment. The data quality appears moderate, with some sources being low quality, like Quora and generic 2023 analyses. I think a score of 68 is reasonable. Additionally, I need to cite relevant sources for the outcome reasoning and include factors that highlight the importance of the House schedule and impeachment processes. The new Congress will indeed be seated in January following elections, as usual, but I should avoid unsupported statements. Also, H.Res.353 is currently in committee without action to move it to the floor.",

The articles of impeachment include allegations of obstruction of justice, violation of due process, and failure to faithfully execute laws. \n\nFor your query regarding whether Trump will be impeached by the end of 2026, the resolution must pass through the House of Representatives with a simple majority vote. The timeline for this process is set between July 24, 2025, and the end of 2026. Thus, the potential for impeachment exists, but it depends on the legislative actions taken during that period.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- [skip to main content](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov#content)\n\n[Citation](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov#citation)[Subscribe](https://www.congress.gov/get-alerts)[Share/Save](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov#share)[Site Feedback](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov#survey)\n\n# H.Res.353 - Impeaching Donald John Trump, Pre\n\n### Content\n[skip to main content](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov#content)\n\n[Citation](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov#citation)[Subscribe](https://www.congress.gov/get-alerts)[Share/Save](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov#share)[Site Feedback](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov#survey)\n\n# H.Res.353 - Impeaching Donald John Trump, President of the United States, for high crimes and misdemeanors. 119th Congress (2025-2026) \\| [Get alerts](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov)\n\n## Resolution\n\n[Hide Overview](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov)\n\n| Sponsor: | [Rep.

The first impeachment was primarily focused on allegations of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress related to his dealings with Ukraine. The second impeachment followed the January 6 Capitol riot, with charges of incitement of insurrection. Both impeachments resulted in acquittals by the Senate.\n\nRegarding your query about whether Trump will be impeached by the end of 2026, the page does not provide predictions or future outcomes. However, it does detail the historical context and processes of impeachment, which could inform discussions about potential future actions.

Looking back, these are the things I wish I’d done sooner. 1. Your home equity is a gold mine - tap into it instead of getting a loan A lot of people turn to high-interest payday loans when they need cash (please don’t). If you own a home, you might have a much better option: a home equity line of credit ( HELOC). A HELOC lets you borrow against the equity in your house - kind of like a credit card, but with lower interest rates and more flexible repayment terms than most traditional loans. It’s often one of the cheapest ways to borrow money when you really need it. If you’re curious, here’s a calculator to see how much you might be able to get: link here. 2. Compare auto insurance companies every 6-12 months. If you haven’t compared auto insurance offers in the last 6 months, you’re probably overspending (on average by ~$460/year ¹). Example: I finally shopped around and ended up saving ~$1,300 this year by switching carriers for the exact same coverage. It took me about 5 minutes. Seriously, just check a comparison site (I used Coverage.com, but Auto-Savings.com works too). You’ll get multiple offers in one go, and worst case? You stay with what you’ve got. Best case? You save a few hundred bucks a year. Here’s a link to a decent comparison site: link. 3. Stop getting price gouged when you shop online. Big retailers (looking at you, Amazon) know that most people don’t have time to compare pri\n\n---\n\n## Source 5: Trump team is already preparing for an impeachment fight in case Dems take control of the House in 2026\nURL: https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-team-already-preparing-impeachment-171031627.html\nPublished: 2025-04-29T00:00:00.000Z\n\n### Summary\nThe article discusses the preparations of Donald Trump's team for a potential impeachment battle if Democrats regain control of the House of Representatives in the 2026 midterm elections.

Given the Republican majority in the House and Senate, the likelihood of impeachment passing is low, but if it were to occur, it could lead to a Senate trial that would disrupt Trump's second term and influence the political landscape leading into the 2026 midterm elections. The Constitution allows for multiple impeachments, raising questions about the grounds for such actions, especially if they are based on policy statements. Thus, while impeachment by the end of 2026 is uncertain, the ongoing political divisions suggest it remains a topic of discussion.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Latest\n[Full List of Democrats Who Voted to End Government Shutdown](https://www.newsweek.com/full-list-of-democrats-who-voted-to-end-government-shutdown-11019295)\n\n- Nation\n\n[News](https://www.newsweek.com/news) [Politics](https://www.newsweek.com/politics) [Tech](https://www.newsweek.com/technology) [Fact Check](https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check) [Person\n\n### Content\nLatest\n[Full List of Democrats Who Voted to End Government Shutdown](https://www.newsweek.com/full-list-of-democrats-who-voted-to-end-government-shutdown-11019295)\n\n- Nation\n\n[News](https://www.newsweek.com/news) [Politics](https://www.newsweek.com/politics) [Tech](https://www.newsweek.com/technology) [Fact Check](https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check) [Personal Finance](https://www.newsweek.com/personal-finance) [Automotive](https://www.newsweek.com/autos) [Sports](https://www.newsweek.com/sports) [Better Workplaces](https://www.newsweek.com/better-workplaces)\n\n- World\n\n[Russia-Ukraine](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/russia) [Middle East](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/middle-east) [China And Asia](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/china) [Better Planet](https://www.newsweek.com/better-planet) [All World News](https://www.newsweek.com/world)\n\n- Lifestyle\n\n[Family & Parenting](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/parenting) [Entertainment](https://www.newsweek.com/entertainment) [Travel](https://www.newsweek.com/travel) [Pets](https://www.newsweek.com/pets) [Relationships](https://www.newsweek.com/relationships) [Science](https://www.newsweek.com/tech-science) [Health](https://www.newsweek.com/health)\n\n- Opinion\n\n[My Turn](https://www.newsweek.com/my-turn) [All Opinion](https://www.newsweek.com/opinion)\n\n- Rankings\n\n[Health](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/health) [Finance](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/finance) [Products](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/products-\n\n---\n\n## Source 8: Impeach Trump 2025\nURL: https://csr.cs.uml.edu/impeach-trump-2025\nPublished: 2025-03-31T00:00:00.000Z\nAuthor: Ashley\n\n### Summary\nThe article discusses the potential for a second impeachment of former President Donald Trump in 2025, considering the political and legal landscape at that time. It highlights that the context of a second impeachment would differ from the first, which focused on abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Key factors that could lead to impeachment include controversial policy decisions, allegations of financial misconduct, and foreign policy controversies. For example, actions such as restricting reproductive healthcare access or engaging in financial corruption could provoke calls for impeachment. The article suggests that if significant issues arise during Trump's second term, it could lead to a renewed push for impeachment, particularly if the House of Representatives votes to approve articles of impeachment by the end of 2026.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- In the aftermath of the tumultuous 2020 presidential election and the events that unfolded during the subsequent four years, the topic of impeaching former President Donald Trump continues to stir significant interest and debate.

This article delves into the implications and possibilities of such an event occurring once again in 2025, exploring the political landscape, legal intricacies, and potential outcomes. \n The Context of a Second Impeachment The year 2025 marks a significant juncture in American political history, as it coincides with the potential end of a second term for President Trump or the start of a new administration, should he be unseated. The idea of a second impeachment gains traction amidst the ongoing discussions and debates surrounding the legacy of the 45th President and the impact of his policies and actions on the nation. \n While the first impeachment trial, which occurred in early 2020, focused primarily on allegations of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, the prospect of a second impeachment would likely revolve around a different set of circumstances and charges. The specific events and actions leading up to such a scenario are impossible to predict with certainty, but several potential factors could contribute to a second impeachment effort. \n The Impact of Policy Decisions \n One key aspect that could trigger a renewed call for impeachment is the potential for controversial policy decisions made by President Trump during his second term.\n\n---\n\n# Grok Web Search Results\n\nThe following search results provide additional real-time context:\n\n## Result 1: Experts Weigh in on Potential Trump Impeachment by 2026\nURL: https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/15/politics/trump-impeachment-prospects/\nSource: CNN\nPublished: 2023-09-15T14:30:00Z\n\nPolitical analysts discuss the likelihood of Donald Trump facing impeachment if he returns to the presidency in 2025.

## Source 1: Text - H.Res.353 - 119th Congress (2025-2026): Impeaching Donald John Trump, President of the United States, for high crimes and misdemeanors.
URL: https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/353/text
Published: 2025-05-13T00:00:00.000Z
Author: Rep. Thanedar, Shri [D-MI-13]

### Summary
The resolution H.Res.353, introduced by Rep. Shri Thanedar on April 28, 2025, seeks to impeach President Donald Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors. The bill has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee and is currently in the "Introduced" status. The articles of impeachment include allegations of obstruction of justice, violation of due process, and failure to faithfully execute laws. 

For your query regarding whether Trump will be impeached by the end of 2026, the resolution must pass through the House of Representatives with a simple majority vote. The timeline for this process is set between July 24, 2025, and the end of 2026. Thus, the potential for impeachment exists, but it depends on the legislative actions taken during that period.

### Summary
The Wikipedia page on "Efforts to impeach Donald Trump" outlines the two formal impeachment proceedings against him: the first in 2019-2020 and the second in 2021. The first impeachment was primarily focused on allegations of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress related to his dealings with Ukraine. The second impeachment followed the January 6 Capitol riot, with charges of incitement of insurrection. Both impeachments resulted in acquittals by the Senate.

Regarding your query about whether Trump will be impeached by the end of 2026, the page does not provide predictions or future outcomes. However, it does detail the historical context and processes of impeachment, which could inform discussions about potential future actions. For the market resolution you mentioned, it would depend on whether the House of Representatives votes to approve articles of impeachment against Trump during the specified timeframe.

### Summary
The webpage does not provide relevant information regarding the likelihood of Donald Trump being impeached by the end of 2026, particularly in the context of the Democrats taking over both chambers of Congress after the 2026 midterm elections. Instead, it focuses on financial advice for homeowners, including tips on utilizing home equity, comparing auto insurance, and saving money while shopping online. For insights on Trump's impeachment prospects, consider looking for political analysis or news articles that specifically address the potential for impeachment in relation to the upcoming elections.

When I bought my first home, I had no idea how many little expenses would pile up. Looking back, these are the things I wish I’d done sooner. 1. Your home equity is a gold mine - tap into it instead of getting a loan A lot of people turn to high-interest payday loans when they need cash (please don’t). If you own a home, you might have a much better option: a home equity line of credit ( HELOC). A HELOC lets you borrow against the equity in your house - kind of like a credit card, but with lower interest rates and more flexible repayment terms than most traditional loans. It’s often one of the cheapest ways to borrow money when you really need it. If you’re curious, here’s a calculator to see how much you might be able to get: link here. 2. Compare auto insurance companies every 6-12 months. If you haven’t compared auto insurance offers in the last 6 months, you’re probably overspending (on average by ~$460/year ¹). Example: I finally shopped around and ended up saving ~$1,300 this year by switching carriers for the exact same coverage. It took me about 5 minutes. Seriously, just check a comparison site (I used Coverage.com, but Auto-Savings.com works too). You’ll get multiple offers in one go, and worst case? You stay with what you’ve got. Best case? You save a few hundred bucks a year. Here’s a link to a decent comparison site: link. 3. Stop getting price gouged when you shop online. Big retailers (looking at you, Amazon) know that most people don’t have time to compare pri

Author: By Andrew Stanton and Jenna deJongShareNewsweek is a Trust Project member

### Summary
The article discusses the possibility of a third impeachment for Donald Trump, initiated by Representative Al Green. Given the Republican majority in the House and Senate, the likelihood of impeachment passing is low, but if it were to occur, it could lead to a Senate trial that would disrupt Trump's second term and influence the political landscape leading into the 2026 midterm elections. The Constitution allows for multiple impeachments, raising questions about the grounds for such actions, especially if they are based on policy statements. Thus, while impeachment by the end of 2026 is uncertain, the ongoing political divisions suggest it remains a topic of discussion.

### Summary
The article discusses the potential for a second impeachment of former President Donald Trump in 2025, considering the political and legal landscape at that time. It highlights that the context of a second impeachment would differ from the first, which focused on abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Key factors that could lead to impeachment include controversial policy decisions, allegations of financial misconduct, and foreign policy controversies. For example, actions such as restricting reproductive healthcare access or engaging in financial corruption could provoke calls for impeachment. The article suggests that if significant issues arise during Trump's second term, it could lead to a renewed push for impeachment, particularly if the House of Representatives votes to approve articles of impeachment by the end of 2026.

 In the aftermath of the tumultuous 2020 presidential election and the events that unfolded during the subsequent four years, the topic of impeaching former President Donald Trump continues to stir significant interest and debate. This article delves into the implications and possibilities of such an event occurring once again in 2025, exploring the political landscape, legal intricacies, and potential outcomes. 
 The Context of a Second Impeachment The year 2025 marks a significant juncture in American political history, as it coincides with the potential end of a second term for President Trump or the start of a new administration, should he be unseated. The idea of a second impeachment gains traction amidst the ongoing discussions and debates surrounding the legacy of the 45th President and the impact of his policies and actions on the nation. 
 While the first impeachment trial, which occurred in early 2020, focused primarily on allegations of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, the prospect of a second impeachment would likely revolve around a different set of circumstances and charges. The specific events and actions leading up to such a scenario are impossible to predict with certainty, but several potential factors could contribute to a second impeachment effort. 
 The Impact of Policy Decisions 
 One key aspect that could trigger a renewed call for impeachment is the potential for controversial policy decisions made by President Trump during his second term.
