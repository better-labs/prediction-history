## AI Prediction Overview

- Market Prediction: 8.50%
- AI Prediction: 11%
- Confidence: 70%
- AI Prediction Delta: 2.50%

### Key Factors
- The 119th Congress remains in place through December 31, 2026; any 2026 midterm majority change takes effect in January 2027, beyond the market window.
- H.Res.353 was introduced and noticed as a privileged resolution but has not been approved; the Republican majority can block or table it (Source 1: Congress.gov; Source 6: GovInfo).
- Newsweek reporting indicates Republican control of the House in 2025, making passage of impeachment articles unlikely (Source 7).
- Impeachment requires only a simple majority, but partisan incentives strongly disfavor Republicans impeaching a Republican president.
- Privileged resolutions can force consideration but not passage; majority party control remains decisive.
- Rare possibility of mid-Congress majority flips via special elections or mass defections, but no evidence suggests such a scenario is likely within the window.
- Even if Democrats win the 2026 election, they cannot act before the market deadline due to congressional seating schedules.

### Outcome Reasoning
(1) Resolution window and House control timeline: The market resolves Yes only if the House approves impeachment articles between July 24, 2025 and December 31, 2026. The 119th Congress runs January 3, 2025–January 3, 2027, so any impeachment vote prior to December 31, 2026 would occur under the 119th Congress. Even if Democrats win the November 2026 elections, the new majority would not be seated until January 2027—outside this market’s window. This timing substantially limits viable pathways to a Yes outcome within 2026.

(2) Current status of impeachment efforts and majority posture: A formal impeachment resolution (H.Res.353) was introduced on April 28, 2025 and referred to the House Judiciary Committee; on May 13, 2025, the sponsor notified the House of intent to offer a privileged resolution (Source 1: Congress.gov; Source 6: GovInfo). However, credible reporting indicates a Republican majority in 2025, making passage of impeachment articles highly unlikely in the current Congress (Source 7: Newsweek). A privileged resolution can force consideration, but a majority can table, refer, or otherwise block it. There is no evidence in the research that House leadership plans to advance impeachment or that bipartisan support exists sufficient to overcome majority opposition.

(3) Political incentives and rarity of mid-Congress majority flips: Impeachment requires only a simple majority, but Republicans have strong incentives not to impeach a Republican president. While a mid-Congress majority flip via special elections or mass resignations is theoretically possible, it is historically rare and unsupported by current evidence in the provided research. Preparations for a possible post-2026 impeachment if Democrats gain the House are noted (Source 5: Yahoo link reports team preparation), but any action by a new majority would occur in 2027 and thus not resolve this market.

• Sources: H.Res.353 introduction and privileged intent (Source 1: Congress.gov; Source 6: GovInfo). Republican control making passage unlikely (Source 7: Newsweek). Background on impeachment efforts and context (Source 3: Wikipedia).
• Structural factors: Market’s date constraints, congressional seating schedules, and majority party control dynamics strongly point to No within the specified window.

### Confidence Reasoning
(1) Strong structural constraints: Confidence is bolstered by the fixed timing of congressional terms and the market’s end date, which together preclude a newly elected 2026 majority from acting before December 31, 2026. This structural factor is clear and well-understood.

(2) Primary-source confirmation of current bill status: Congress.gov and GovInfo (Sources 1 and 6) are high-reliability primary sources confirming H.Res.353’s introduction and current procedural status, indicating no House approval to date and no sign of imminent passage.

(3) Remaining uncertainties: Confidence is tempered by potential—but low-probability—paths such as unexpected scandals leading to Republican defections or a rare mid-Congress majority change via special elections. The available research does not provide detailed, verified forecasts of House control shifts or member churn through the end of 2026. Some sources (e.g., Source 5 Yahoo link, Source 2 UCSF page) are of mixed quality or tangential, and the Grok search results are general trend pieces without verifiable, specific evidence.

• Net effect: High-quality procedural data and timeline logic drive a No prediction, but incomplete visibility into potential shocks keeps confidence below very high levels.

The resolution has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee and is currently in the introduced stage. It outlines charges against Trump, including obstruction of justice and violations of due process. The resolution aims to exhibit articles of impeachment to the Senate, but as of now, it has not yet been voted on by the House. \n\nIf you are inquiring whether Trump will be impeached by the end of 2026, the outcome will depend on the House's decision to approve the articles of impeachment, which must occur by a simple majority vote. The timeline for this process is uncertain, but the resolution's introduction marks the beginning of potential impeachment proceedings.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- [skip to main content](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov#content)\n\n[Citation](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov#citation)[Subscribe](https://www.congress.gov/get-alerts)[Share/Save](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov#share)[Site Feedback](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov#survey)\n\n# H.Res.353 - Impeaching Donald John Trump, Pre\n\n### Content\n[skip to main content](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov#content)\n\n[Citation](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov#citation)[Subscribe](https://www.congress.gov/get-alerts)[Share/Save](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov#share)[Site Feedback](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov#survey)\n\n# H.Res.353 - Impeaching Donald John Trump, President of the United States, for high crimes and misdemeanors. 119th Congress (2025-2026) \\| [Get alerts](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov)\n\n## Resolution\n\n[Hide Overview](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov)\n\n| Sponsor: | [Rep.

It outlines the constitutional framework for impeachment, which involves a two-stage process: the House of Representatives votes to impeach, and the Senate conducts a trial. The text also reviews Trump's previous impeachments, detailing the charges of abuse of power and incitement of insurrection. Additionally, it explores the implications of these events for future presidencies, including concerns about lowering the bar for impeachment and increasing political polarization.\n\nRegarding your query about whether Trump will be impeached by the end of 2026, the webpage does not provide a definitive answer or prediction. It emphasizes that the impeachment process requires a majority vote in the House, which could occur between July 24, 2025, and the end of 2026, but does not speculate on the likelihood of such an event.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- 2025 Trump Impeachment \n \n \n The potential impeachment of Donald Trump in 2025 is a topic of interest and speculation, particularly given the controversial nature of his presidency and the unprecedented events that occurred during his time in office.

The first impeachment inquiry took place from 2019 to 2020, leading to his first impeachment by the House of Representatives on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The second impeachment occurred in early 2021, following the January 6 Capitol riot, where he was charged with incitement of insurrection.\n\nRegarding your query about whether Trump will be impeached by the end of 2026, the page does not provide predictions or future resolutions.

Looking back, these are the things I wish I’d done sooner. 1. Your home equity is a gold mine - tap into it instead of getting a loan A lot of people turn to high-interest payday loans when they need cash (please don’t). If you own a home, you might have a much better option: a home equity line of credit ( HELOC). A HELOC lets you borrow against the equity in your house - kind of like a credit card, but with lower interest rates and more flexible repayment terms than most traditional loans. It’s often one of the cheapest ways to borrow money when you really need it. If you’re curious, here’s a calculator to see how much you might be able to get: link here. 2. Compare auto insurance companies every 6-12 months. If you haven’t compared auto insurance offers in the last 6 months, you’re probably overspending (on average by ~$460/year ¹). Example: I finally shopped around and ended up saving ~$1,300 this year by switching carriers for the exact same coverage. It took me about 5 minutes. Seriously, just check a comparison site (I used Coverage.com, but Auto-Savings.com works too). You’ll get multiple offers in one go, and worst case? You stay with what you’ve got. Best case? You save a few hundred bucks a year. Here’s a link to a decent comparison site: link. 3. Stop getting price gouged when you shop online.

Following his previous impeachments, Trump's advisers are taking the threat seriously, especially as Democrats have already indicated intentions to file articles of impeachment early in his second term. The urgency to push through his legislative agenda, including extending tax cuts set to expire in 2025, has intensified. Key figures, including pollster John McLaughlin, emphasize the importance of securing the midterms to avoid a recession and mitigate impeachment risks.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Return to Homepage](https://www.yahoo.com)\n\n## Top Stories:\n\n- [Senate reaches shutdown deal](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/senators-near-deal-reopen-government-200820963.html)\n- [Flight cancellations](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/thanksgiving-air-traffic-could-slow-163901620.html)\n- [SNAP benefits paused](https://\n\n### Content\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Return to Homepage](https://www.yahoo.com)\n\n## Top Stories:\n\n- [Senate reaches shutdown deal](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/senators-near-deal-reopen-government-200820963.html)\n- [Flight cancellations](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/thanksgiving-air-traffic-could-slow-163901620.html)\n- [SNAP benefits paused](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-administration-tells-states-undo-155333628.html)\n- [Trump talks healthcare](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-urges-lawmakers-healthcare-money-145631423.html)\n- [Abrego Garcia update](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-admin-moves-dissolve-ban-152533849.html)\n- [More flights canceled](https://www.yahoo.com/news/us/live/flights-canceled-at-40-us-airports-full-coverage-as-faa-cuts-to-air-traffic-take-effect-amid-government-shutdown-162954349.html)\n- [NASA's journey to Mars](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/next-mars-launch-window-2026-122601304.html)\n- [A record Arctic blast?](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/early-arctic-cold-snap-could-184000871.html)\n- [Senate works the weekend](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/senators-weekend-shutdown-republicans-democrats-050149827.html)\n- [Full SNAP payments paused](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-admin-asks-supreme-court-235859390.html)\n\nTrump team is already preparing for an impeachment fight in case Dems take control of the House in 2026\n\nMore\n\nYahoo is using AI to generate takeaways from this article.

While the Republican majority in the House and Senate makes it unlikely for the impeachment effort to succeed, if articles of impeachment were to pass, it would lead to a Senate trial, potentially impacting Trump's second term and the political landscape heading into the 2026 midterm elections. The Constitution allows for multiple impeachments, raising questions about the grounds for such actions, especially if based on policy statements. This context is crucial for understanding the likelihood of Trump being impeached by the end of 2026, as it hinges on the dynamics within Congress during that period.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Latest\n[Full List of Democrats Who Voted to End Government Shutdown](https://www.newsweek.com/full-list-of-democrats-who-voted-to-end-government-shutdown-11019295)\n\n- Nation\n\n[News](https://www.newsweek.com/news) [Politics](https://www.newsweek.com/politics) [Tech](https://www.newsweek.com/technology) [Fact Check](https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check) [Person\n\n### Content\nLatest\n[Full List of Democrats Who Voted to End Government Shutdown](https://www.newsweek.com/full-list-of-democrats-who-voted-to-end-government-shutdown-11019295)\n\n- Nation\n\n[News](https://www.newsweek.com/news) [Politics](https://www.newsweek.com/politics) [Tech](https://www.newsweek.com/technology) [Fact Check](https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check) [Personal Finance](https://www.newsweek.com/personal-finance) [Automotive](https://www.newsweek.com/autos) [Sports](https://www.newsweek.com/sports) [Better Workplaces](https://www.newsweek.com/better-workplaces)\n\n- World\n\n[Russia-Ukraine](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/russia) [Middle East](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/middle-east) [China And Asia](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/china) [Better Planet](https://www.newsweek.com/better-planet) [All World News](https://www.newsweek.com/world)\n\n- Lifestyle\n\n[Family & Parenting](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/parenting) [Entertainment](https://www.newsweek.com/entertainment) [Travel](https://www.newsweek.com/travel) [Pets](https://www.newsweek.com/pets) [Relationships](https://www.newsweek.com/relationships) [Science](https://www.newsweek.com/tech-science) [Health](https://www.newsweek.com/health)\n\n- Opinion\n\n[My Turn](https://www.newsweek.com/my-turn) [All Opinion](https://www.newsweek.com/opinion)\n\n- Rankings\n\n[Health](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/health) [Finance](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/finance) [Products](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/products-\n\n---\n\n## Source 8: Impeach Trump 2025\nURL: https://csr.cs.uml.edu/impeach-trump-2025\nPublished: 2025-03-31T00:00:00.000Z\nAuthor: Ashley\n\n### Summary\nThe article discusses the potential for a second impeachment of former President Donald Trump in 2025, exploring the political and legal landscape surrounding this possibility. It highlights that the context for such an event could arise from controversial policy decisions, allegations of financial misconduct, or foreign policy controversies during his second term. Specific scenarios, such as restrictive executive orders or revelations of financial impropriety, are presented as potential triggers for impeachment. The article suggests that if significant actions perceived as unconstitutional or unethical occur, they could lead to renewed calls for impeachment, particularly from progressive lawmakers. This analysis is relevant to the user's query about the likelihood of Trump being impeached by the end of 2026, as it outlines the conditions under which impeachment could be pursued.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- In the aftermath of the tumultuous 2020 presidential election and the events that unfolded during the subsequent four years, the topic of impeaching former President Donald Trump continues to stir significant interest and debate.

This article delves into the implications and possibilities of such an event occurring once again in 2025, exploring the political landscape, legal intricacies, and potential outcomes. \n The Context of a Second Impeachment The year 2025 marks a significant juncture in American political history, as it coincides with the potential end of a second term for President Trump or the start of a new administration, should he be unseated. The idea of a second impeachment gains traction amidst the ongoing discussions and debates surrounding the legacy of the 45th President and the impact of his policies and actions on the nation. \n While the first impeachment trial, which occurred in early 2020, focused primarily on allegations of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, the prospect of a second impeachment would likely revolve around a different set of circumstances and charges. The specific events and actions leading up to such a scenario are impossible to predict with certainty, but several potential factors could contribute to a second impeachment effort. \n The Impact of Policy Decisions \n One key aspect that could trigger a renewed call for impeachment is the potential for controversial policy decisions made by President Trump during his second term.\n\n---\n\n# Grok Web Search Results\n\nThe following search results provide additional real-time context:\n\n## Result 1: Experts Analyze Potential Impeachment of Trump if He Returns in 2024\nURL: https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/15/politics/trump-impeachment-prospects-2024/\nSource: CNN\nPublished: 2023-08-15T14:30:00Z\n\nPolitical experts discuss the possibility of Donald Trump facing impeachment if he wins the 2024 election and becomes president again.

The 119th Congress runs January 3, 2025–January 3, 2027, so any impeachment vote prior to December 31, 2026 would occur under the 119th Congress. Even if Democrats win the November 2026 elections, the new majority would not be seated until January 2027—outside this market’s window. This timing substantially limits viable pathways to a Yes outcome within 2026.\\n\\n(2) Current status of impeachment efforts and majority posture: A formal impeachment resolution (H.Res.353) was introduced on April 28, 2025 and referred to the House Judiciary Committee; on May 13, 2025, the sponsor notified the House of intent to offer a privileged resolution (Source 1: Congress.gov; Source 6: GovInfo). However, credible reporting indicates a Republican majority in 2025, making passage of impeachment articles highly unlikely in the current Congress (Source 7: Newsweek). A privileged resolution can force consideration, but a majority can table, refer, or otherwise block it. There is no evidence in the research that House leadership plans to advance impeachment or that bipartisan support exists sufficient to overcome majority opposition.\\n\\n(3) Political incentives and rarity of mid-Congress majority flips: Impeachment requires only a simple majority, but Republicans have strong incentives not to impeach a Republican president. While a mid-Congress majority flip via special elections or mass resignations is theoretically possible, it is historically rare and unsupported by current evidence in the provided research. Preparations for a possible post-2026 impeachment if Democrats gain the House are noted (Source 5: Yahoo link reports team preparation), but any action by a new majority would occur in 2027 and thus not resolve this market.\\n\\n• Sources: H.Res.353 introduction and privileged intent (Source 1: Congress.gov; Source 6: GovInfo).

This structural factor is clear and well-understood.\\n\\n(2) Primary-source confirmation of current bill status: Congress.gov and GovInfo (Sources 1 and 6) are high-reliability primary sources confirming H.Res.353’s introduction and current procedural status, indicating no House approval to date and no sign of imminent passage.\\n\\n(3) Remaining uncertainties: Confidence is tempered by potential—but low-probability—paths such as unexpected scandals leading to Republican defections or a rare mid-Congress majority change via special elections. The available research does not provide detailed, verified forecasts of House control shifts or member churn through the end of 2026. Some sources (e.g., Source 5 Yahoo link, Source 2 UCSF page) are of mixed quality or tangential, and the Grok search results are general trend pieces without verifiable, specific evidence.\\n\\n• Net effect: High-quality procedural data and timeline logic drive a No prediction, but incomplete visibility into potential shocks keeps confidence below very high levels.\",\n  \"probability\": 11,\n  \"keyFactors\": [\n    \"The 119th Congress remains in place through December 31, 2026; any 2026 midterm majority change takes effect in January 2027, beyond the market window.\",\n    \"H.Res.353 was introduced and noticed as a privileged resolution but has not been approved; the Republican majority can block or table it (Source 1: Congress.gov; Source 6: GovInfo).\",\n    \"Newsweek reporting indicates Republican control of the House in 2025, making passage of impeachment articles unlikely (Source 7).\",\n    \"Impeachment requires only a simple majority, but partisan incentives strongly disfavor Republicans impeaching a Republican president.\",\n    \"Privileged resolutions can force consideration but not passage; majority party control remains decisive.\",\n    \"Rare possibility of mid-Congress majority flips via special elections or mass defections, but no evidence suggests such a scenario is likely within the window.\",\n    \"Even if Democrats win the 2026 election, they cannot act before the market deadline due to congressional seating schedules.\"\n  ],\n  \"dataQuality\": 78,\n  \"lastUpdated\": \"2025-11-13T12:00:00Z\"\n}",

I must weigh the reliability of primary sources more heavily since we know that \"Grok Web Search Results\" might be questionable. I'll be careful in evaluating the data quality while following the guidelines.**Assessing impeachment possibility**\n\nI’m considering whether Trump could be impeached by the end of 2026 based on the House's actions. It could happen if the House approves articles of impeachment between July 24, 2025, and December 31, 2026. This scenario seems possible if Democrats gain control after the 2026 midterms or some Republicans defect. I need to evaluate the House control for the 119th Congress since current research indicates a Republican majority. News articles suggest an impeachment is unlikely, but there has been at least one resolution introduced.**Evaluating impeachment likelihood**\n\nIt seems like there’s a potential floor attempt for impeachment. However, a Republican majority could choose to table or refer it. The probability of a \"yes\" by the end of 2026 primarily hinges on whether Democrats win the House in November 2026 and decide to impeach. Evaluating their chances is tricky without current polling. Historically, midterms often favor the opposition party, making gains likely. I need to keep in mind the time frame from mid-2025 to the end of 2026 and the lame-duck period afterward.**Clarifying congressional timeline**\n\nI need to clarify the timeline regarding the 2026 midterm elections, which will seat members for the 120th Congress starting January 3, 2027. The House elections occur every two years, meaning the current Congress is actually the 119th, and that the new majority wouldn’t take effect until January 3, 2027, after the market period ends on December 31, 2026. If Republicans control the 119th Congress through 2025-2026, an impeachment vote seems highly unlikely. It's crucial to verify this assumption about House seats and the timing.**Analyzing impeachment odds**\n\nThe current Congress is the 119th, running from January 3, 2025, to January 3, 2027. The market ends on December 31, 2026, before the new majority is seated. This means that any impeachment vote will occur under a Republican-controlled House, making impeachment unlikely by that date. Additionally, even if Democrats win in 2026, they won’t have the majority until January 2027, outside the market's timeframe. I should clarify these key factors and cite relevant sources.",

If Republicans control the 119th Congress through 2025-2026, an impeachment vote seems highly unlikely. It's crucial to verify this assumption about House seats and the timing.**Analyzing impeachment odds**\n\nThe current Congress is the 119th, running from January 3, 2025, to January 3, 2027. The market ends on December 31, 2026, before the new majority is seated. This means that any impeachment vote will occur under a Republican-controlled House, making impeachment unlikely by that date. Additionally, even if Democrats win in 2026, they won’t have the majority until January 2027, outside the market's timeframe. I should clarify these key factors and cite relevant sources.",

Thanedar, Shri [D-MI-13]\n\n### Summary\nThe resolution H.Res.353, introduced by Rep. Shri Thanedar on April 28, 2025, seeks to impeach President Donald Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors. The resolution has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee and is currently in the introduced stage. It outlines charges against Trump, including obstruction of justice and violations of due process. The resolution aims to exhibit articles of impeachment to the Senate, but as of now, it has not yet been voted on by the House. \n\nIf you are inquiring whether Trump will be impeached by the end of 2026, the outcome will depend on the House's decision to approve the articles of impeachment, which must occur by a simple majority vote. The timeline for this process is uncertain, but the resolution's introduction marks the beginning of potential impeachment proceedings.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- [skip to main content](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov#content)\n\n[Citation](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov#citation)[Subscribe](https://www.congress.gov/get-alerts)[Share/Save](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov#share)[Site Feedback](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov#survey)\n\n# H.Res.353 - Impeaching Donald John Trump, Pre\n\n### Content\n[skip to main content](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov#content)\n\n[Citation](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov#citation)[Subscribe](https://www.congress.gov/get-alerts)[Share/Save](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov#share)[Site Feedback](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov#survey)\n\n# H.Res.353 - Impeaching Donald John Trump, President of the United States, for high crimes and misdemeanors. 119th Congress (2025-2026) \\| [Get alerts](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov)\n\n## Resolution\n\n[Hide Overview](https://www.congress.gov/www.congress.gov)\n\n| Sponsor: | [Rep.

It outlines the constitutional framework for impeachment, which involves a two-stage process: the House of Representatives votes to impeach, and the Senate conducts a trial. The text also reviews Trump's previous impeachments, detailing the charges of abuse of power and incitement of insurrection. Additionally, it explores the implications of these events for future presidencies, including concerns about lowering the bar for impeachment and increasing political polarization.\n\nRegarding your query about whether Trump will be impeached by the end of 2026, the webpage does not provide a definitive answer or prediction. It emphasizes that the impeachment process requires a majority vote in the House, which could occur between July 24, 2025, and the end of 2026, but does not speculate on the likelihood of such an event.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- 2025 Trump Impeachment \n \n \n The potential impeachment of Donald Trump in 2025 is a topic of interest and speculation, particularly given the controversial nature of his presidency and the unprecedented events that occurred during his time in office.

The first impeachment inquiry took place from 2019 to 2020, leading to his first impeachment by the House of Representatives on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.

Looking back, these are the things I wish I’d done sooner. 1. Your home equity is a gold mine - tap into it instead of getting a loan A lot of people turn to high-interest payday loans when they need cash (please don’t). If you own a home, you might have a much better option: a home equity line of credit ( HELOC). A HELOC lets you borrow against the equity in your house - kind of like a credit card, but with lower interest rates and more flexible repayment terms than most traditional loans. It’s often one of the cheapest ways to borrow money when you really need it. If you’re curious, here’s a calculator to see how much you might be able to get: link here. 2. Compare auto insurance companies every 6-12 months. If you haven’t compared auto insurance offers in the last 6 months, you’re probably overspending (on average by ~$460/year ¹). Example: I finally shopped around and ended up saving ~$1,300 this year by switching carriers for the exact same coverage. It took me about 5 minutes. Seriously, just check a comparison site (I used Coverage.com, but Auto-Savings.com works too). You’ll get multiple offers in one go, and worst case? You stay with what you’ve got. Best case? You save a few hundred bucks a year. Here’s a link to a decent comparison site: link. 3. Stop getting price gouged when you shop online.

Following his previous impeachments, Trump's advisers are taking the threat seriously, especially as Democrats have already indicated intentions to file articles of impeachment early in his second term. The urgency to push through his legislative agenda, including extending tax cuts set to expire in 2025, has intensified. Key figures, including pollster John McLaughlin, emphasize the importance of securing the midterms to avoid a recession and mitigate impeachment risks.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Return to Homepage](https://www.yahoo.com)\n\n## Top Stories:\n\n- [Senate reaches shutdown deal](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/senators-near-deal-reopen-government-200820963.html)\n- [Flight cancellations](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/thanksgiving-air-traffic-could-slow-163901620.html)\n- [SNAP benefits paused](https://\n\n### Content\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Return to Homepage](https://www.yahoo.com)\n\n## Top Stories:\n\n- [Senate reaches shutdown deal](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/senators-near-deal-reopen-government-200820963.html)\n- [Flight cancellations](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/thanksgiving-air-traffic-could-slow-163901620.html)\n- [SNAP benefits paused](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-administration-tells-states-undo-155333628.html)\n- [Trump talks healthcare](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-urges-lawmakers-healthcare-money-145631423.html)\n- [Abrego Garcia update](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-admin-moves-dissolve-ban-152533849.html)\n- [More flights canceled](https://www.yahoo.com/news/us/live/flights-canceled-at-40-us-airports-full-coverage-as-faa-cuts-to-air-traffic-take-effect-amid-government-shutdown-162954349.html)\n- [NASA's journey to Mars](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/next-mars-launch-window-2026-122601304.html)\n- [A record Arctic blast?](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/early-arctic-cold-snap-could-184000871.html)\n- [Senate works the weekend](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/senators-weekend-shutdown-republicans-democrats-050149827.html)\n- [Full SNAP payments paused](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-admin-asks-supreme-court-235859390.html)\n\nTrump team is already preparing for an impeachment fight in case Dems take control of the House in 2026\n\nMore\n\nYahoo is using AI to generate takeaways from this article.

While the Republican majority in the House and Senate makes it unlikely for the impeachment effort to succeed, if articles of impeachment were to pass, it would lead to a Senate trial, potentially impacting Trump's second term and the political landscape heading into the 2026 midterm elections. The Constitution allows for multiple impeachments, raising questions about the grounds for such actions, especially if based on policy statements. This context is crucial for understanding the likelihood of Trump being impeached by the end of 2026, as it hinges on the dynamics within Congress during that period.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Latest\n[Full List of Democrats Who Voted to End Government Shutdown](https://www.newsweek.com/full-list-of-democrats-who-voted-to-end-government-shutdown-11019295)\n\n- Nation\n\n[News](https://www.newsweek.com/news) [Politics](https://www.newsweek.com/politics) [Tech](https://www.newsweek.com/technology) [Fact Check](https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check) [Person\n\n### Content\nLatest\n[Full List of Democrats Who Voted to End Government Shutdown](https://www.newsweek.com/full-list-of-democrats-who-voted-to-end-government-shutdown-11019295)\n\n- Nation\n\n[News](https://www.newsweek.com/news) [Politics](https://www.newsweek.com/politics) [Tech](https://www.newsweek.com/technology) [Fact Check](https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check) [Personal Finance](https://www.newsweek.com/personal-finance) [Automotive](https://www.newsweek.com/autos) [Sports](https://www.newsweek.com/sports) [Better Workplaces](https://www.newsweek.com/better-workplaces)\n\n- World\n\n[Russia-Ukraine](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/russia) [Middle East](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/middle-east) [China And Asia](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/china) [Better Planet](https://www.newsweek.com/better-planet) [All World News](https://www.newsweek.com/world)\n\n- Lifestyle\n\n[Family & Parenting](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/parenting) [Entertainment](https://www.newsweek.com/entertainment) [Travel](https://www.newsweek.com/travel) [Pets](https://www.newsweek.com/pets) [Relationships](https://www.newsweek.com/relationships) [Science](https://www.newsweek.com/tech-science) [Health](https://www.newsweek.com/health)\n\n- Opinion\n\n[My Turn](https://www.newsweek.com/my-turn) [All Opinion](https://www.newsweek.com/opinion)\n\n- Rankings\n\n[Health](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/health) [Finance](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/finance) [Products](https://rankings.newsweek.com/category/products-\n\n---\n\n## Source 8: Impeach Trump 2025\nURL: https://csr.cs.uml.edu/impeach-trump-2025\nPublished: 2025-03-31T00:00:00.000Z\nAuthor: Ashley\n\n### Summary\nThe article discusses the potential for a second impeachment of former President Donald Trump in 2025, exploring the political and legal landscape surrounding this possibility.

This article delves into the implications and possibilities of such an event occurring once again in 2025, exploring the political landscape, legal intricacies, and potential outcomes. \n The Context of a Second Impeachment The year 2025 marks a significant juncture in American political history, as it coincides with the potential end of a second term for President Trump or the start of a new administration, should he be unseated. The idea of a second impeachment gains traction amidst the ongoing discussions and debates surrounding the legacy of the 45th President and the impact of his policies and actions on the nation. \n While the first impeachment trial, which occurred in early 2020, focused primarily on allegations of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, the prospect of a second impeachment would likely revolve around a different set of circumstances and charges. The specific events and actions leading up to such a scenario are impossible to predict with certainty, but several potential factors could contribute to a second impeachment effort. \n The Impact of Policy Decisions \n One key aspect that could trigger a renewed call for impeachment is the potential for controversial policy decisions made by President Trump during his second term.\n\n---\n\n# Grok Web Search Results\n\nThe following search results provide additional real-time context:\n\n## Result 1: Experts Analyze Potential Impeachment of Trump if He Returns in 2024\nURL: https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/15/politics/trump-impeachment-prospects-2024/\nSource: CNN\nPublished: 2023-08-15T14:30:00Z\n\nPolitical experts discuss the possibility of Donald Trump facing impeachment if he wins the 2024 election and becomes president again.

### Summary
The Wikipedia page on "Efforts to impeach Donald Trump" details the formal impeachment proceedings against him, specifically the two major impeachments that occurred during his presidency. The first impeachment inquiry took place from 2019 to 2020, leading to his first impeachment by the House of Representatives on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The second impeachment occurred in early 2021, following the January 6 Capitol riot, where he was charged with incitement of insurrection.

Regarding your query about whether Trump will be impeached by the end of 2026, the page does not provide predictions or future resolutions. It focuses on past events and the legal framework surrounding the impeachment process. For your specific question, the resolution will depend on future actions by the House of Representatives, which cannot be determined at this time.

### Summary
The webpage does not provide relevant information regarding the likelihood of Donald Trump being impeached by the end of 2026, particularly in the context of the Democrats taking control of Congress after the 2026 midterm elections. Instead, it focuses on financial advice for homeowners, including topics like home equity loans, auto insurance comparisons, and online shopping tips. For insights on Trump's impeachment prospects, consider looking for political analysis or news articles that specifically address the political landscape and potential impeachment scenarios as the 2026 elections approach.

When I bought my first home, I had no idea how many little expenses would pile up. Looking back, these are the things I wish I’d done sooner. 1. Your home equity is a gold mine - tap into it instead of getting a loan A lot of people turn to high-interest payday loans when they need cash (please don’t). If you own a home, you might have a much better option: a home equity line of credit ( HELOC). A HELOC lets you borrow against the equity in your house - kind of like a credit card, but with lower interest rates and more flexible repayment terms than most traditional loans. It’s often one of the cheapest ways to borrow money when you really need it. If you’re curious, here’s a calculator to see how much you might be able to get: link here. 2. Compare auto insurance companies every 6-12 months. If you haven’t compared auto insurance offers in the last 6 months, you’re probably overspending (on average by ~$460/year ¹). Example: I finally shopped around and ended up saving ~$1,300 this year by switching carriers for the exact same coverage. It took me about 5 minutes. Seriously, just check a comparison site (I used Coverage.com, but Auto-Savings.com works too). You’ll get multiple offers in one go, and worst case? You stay with what you’ve got. Best case? You save a few hundred bucks a year. Here’s a link to a decent comparison site: link. 3. Stop getting price gouged when you shop online. Big retailers (looking at you, Amazon) know that most people don’t have time to compare pri

### Summary
The Trump team is proactively preparing for a potential third impeachment if Democrats regain control of the House in the 2026 midterm elections. Following his previous impeachments, Trump's advisers are taking the threat seriously, especially as Democrats have already indicated intentions to file articles of impeachment early in his second term. The urgency to push through his legislative agenda, including extending tax cuts set to expire in 2025, has intensified. Key figures, including pollster John McLaughlin, emphasize the importance of securing the midterms to avoid a recession and mitigate impeachment risks.

Published: 2025-02-06T00:00:00.000Z
Author: By Andrew Stanton and Jenna deJongShareNewsweek is a Trust Project member

### Summary
The article discusses the possibility of a third impeachment of Donald Trump, led by Representative Al Green, amidst a politically divided Congress. While the Republican majority in the House and Senate makes it unlikely for the impeachment effort to succeed, if articles of impeachment were to pass, it would lead to a Senate trial, potentially impacting Trump's second term and the political landscape heading into the 2026 midterm elections. The Constitution allows for multiple impeachments, raising questions about the grounds for such actions, especially if based on policy statements. This context is crucial for understanding the likelihood of Trump being impeached by the end of 2026, as it hinges on the dynamics within Congress during that period.

### Summary
The article discusses the potential for a second impeachment of former President Donald Trump in 2025, exploring the political and legal landscape surrounding this possibility.

 In the aftermath of the tumultuous 2020 presidential election and the events that unfolded during the subsequent four years, the topic of impeaching former President Donald Trump continues to stir significant interest and debate. This article delves into the implications and possibilities of such an event occurring once again in 2025, exploring the political landscape, legal intricacies, and potential outcomes. 
 The Context of a Second Impeachment The year 2025 marks a significant juncture in American political history, as it coincides with the potential end of a second term for President Trump or the start of a new administration, should he be unseated. The idea of a second impeachment gains traction amidst the ongoing discussions and debates surrounding the legacy of the 45th President and the impact of his policies and actions on the nation. 
 While the first impeachment trial, which occurred in early 2020, focused primarily on allegations of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, the prospect of a second impeachment would likely revolve around a different set of circumstances and charges. The specific events and actions leading up to such a scenario are impossible to predict with certainty, but several potential factors could contribute to a second impeachment effort. 
 The Impact of Policy Decisions 
 One key aspect that could trigger a renewed call for impeachment is the potential for controversial policy decisions made by President Trump during his second term.

It outlines the constitutional framework for impeachment, which involves a two-stage process: the House of Representatives votes to impeach, and the Senate conducts a trial. The text also reviews Trump's previous impeachments, detailing the charges of abuse of power and incitement of insurrection. Additionally, it explores the implications of these events for future presidencies, including concerns about lowering the bar for impeachment and increasing political polarization.\n\nRegarding your query about whether Trump will be impeached by the end of 2026, the webpage does not provide a definitive answer or prediction. It emphasizes that the impeachment process requires a majority vote in the House, which could occur between July 24, 2025, and the end of 2026, but does not speculate on the likelihood of such an event.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- 2025 Trump Impeachment \n \n \n The potential impeachment of Donald Trump in 2025 is a topic of interest and speculation, particularly given the controversial nature of his presidency and the unprecedented events that occurred during his time in office.

The first impeachment inquiry took place from 2019 to 2020, leading to his first impeachment by the House of Representatives on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The second impeachment occurred in early 2021, following the January 6 Capitol riot, where he was charged with incitement of insurrection.\n\nRegarding your query about whether Trump will be impeached by the end of 2026, the page does not provide predictions or future resolutions.

Looking back, these are the things I wish I’d done sooner. 1. Your home equity is a gold mine - tap into it instead of getting a loan A lot of people turn to high-interest payday loans when they need cash (please don’t). If you own a home, you might have a much better option: a home equity line of credit ( HELOC). A HELOC lets you borrow against the equity in your house - kind of like a credit card, but with lower interest rates and more flexible repayment terms than most traditional loans. It’s often one of the cheapest ways to borrow money when you really need it. If you’re curious, here’s a calculator to see how much you might be able to get: link here. 2. Compare auto insurance companies every 6-12 months. If you haven’t compared auto insurance offers in the last 6 months, you’re probably overspending (on average by ~$460/year ¹). Example: I finally shopped around and ended up saving ~$1,300 this year by switching carriers for the exact same coverage. It took me about 5 minutes. Seriously, just check a comparison site (I used Coverage.com, but Auto-Savings.com works too). You’ll get multiple offers in one go, and worst case? You stay with what you’ve got. Best case? You save a few hundred bucks a year. Here’s a link to a decent comparison site: link. 3. Stop getting price gouged when you shop online.

Following his previous impeachments, Trump's advisers are taking the threat seriously, especially as Democrats have already indicated intentions to file articles of impeachment early in his second term. The urgency to push through his legislative agenda, including extending tax cuts set to expire in 2025, has intensified. Key figures, including pollster John McLaughlin, emphasize the importance of securing the midterms to avoid a recession and mitigate impeachment risks.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Return to Homepage](https://www.yahoo.com)\n\n## Top Stories:\n\n- [Senate reaches shutdown deal](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/senators-near-deal-reopen-government-200820963.html)\n- [Flight cancellations](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/thanksgiving-air-traffic-could-slow-163901620.html)\n- [SNAP benefits paused](https://\n\n### Content\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Return to Homepage](https://www.yahoo.com)\n\n## Top Stories:\n\n- [Senate reaches shutdown deal](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/senators-near-deal-reopen-government-200820963.html)\n- [Flight cancellations](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/thanksgiving-air-traffic-could-slow-163901620.html)\n- [SNAP benefits paused](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-administration-tells-states-undo-155333628.html)\n- [Trump talks healthcare](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-urges-lawmakers-healthcare-money-145631423.html)\n- [Abrego Garcia update](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-admin-moves-dissolve-ban-152533849.html)\n- [More flights canceled](https://www.yahoo.com/news/us/live/flights-canceled-at-40-us-airports-full-coverage-as-faa-cuts-to-air-traffic-take-effect-amid-government-shutdown-162954349.html)\n- [NASA's journey to Mars](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/next-mars-launch-window-2026-122601304.html)\n- [A record Arctic blast?](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/early-arctic-cold-snap-could-184000871.html)\n- [Senate works the weekend](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/senators-weekend-shutdown-republicans-democrats-050149827.html)\n- [Full SNAP payments paused](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-admin-asks-supreme-court-235859390.html)\n\nTrump team is already preparing for an impeachment fight in case Dems take control of the House in 2026\n\nMore\n\nYahoo is using AI to generate takeaways from this article.

While the Republican majority in the House and Senate makes it unlikely for the impeachment effort to succeed, if articles of impeachment were to pass, it would lead to a Senate trial, potentially impacting Trump's second term and the political landscape heading into the 2026 midterm elections. The Constitution allows for multiple impeachments, raising questions about the grounds for such actions, especially if based on policy statements.

This article delves into the implications and possibilities of such an event occurring once again in 2025, exploring the political landscape, legal intricacies, and potential outcomes. \n The Context of a Second Impeachment The year 2025 marks a significant juncture in American political history, as it coincides with the potential end of a second term for President Trump or the start of a new administration, should he be unseated. The idea of a second impeachment gains traction amidst the ongoing discussions and debates surrounding the legacy of the 45th President and the impact of his policies and actions on the nation. \n While the first impeachment trial, which occurred in early 2020, focused primarily on allegations of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, the prospect of a second impeachment would likely revolve around a different set of circumstances and charges. The specific events and actions leading up to such a scenario are impossible to predict with certainty, but several potential factors could contribute to a second impeachment effort. \n The Impact of Policy Decisions \n One key aspect that could trigger a renewed call for impeachment is the potential for controversial policy decisions made by President Trump during his second term.\n\n---\n\n# Grok Web Search Results\n\nThe following search results provide additional real-time context:\n\n## Result 1: Experts Analyze Potential Impeachment of Trump if He Returns in 2024\nURL: https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/15/politics/trump-impeachment-prospects-2024/\nSource: CNN\nPublished: 2023-08-15T14:30:00Z\n\nPolitical experts discuss the possibility of Donald Trump facing impeachment if he wins the 2024 election and becomes president again.

The 119th Congress runs January 3, 2025–January 3, 2027, so any impeachment vote prior to December 31, 2026 would occur under the 119th Congress. Even if Democrats win the November 2026 elections, the new majority would not be seated until January 2027—outside this market’s window. This timing substantially limits viable pathways to a Yes outcome within 2026.\\n\\n(2) Current status of impeachment efforts and majority posture: A formal impeachment resolution (H.Res.353) was introduced on April 28, 2025 and referred to the House Judiciary Committee; on May 13, 2025, the sponsor notified the House of intent to offer a privileged resolution (Source 1: Congress.gov; Source 6: GovInfo). However, credible reporting indicates a Republican majority in 2025, making passage of impeachment articles highly unlikely in the current Congress (Source 7: Newsweek). A privileged resolution can force consideration, but a majority can table, refer, or otherwise block it. There is no evidence in the research that House leadership plans to advance impeachment or that bipartisan support exists sufficient to overcome majority opposition.\\n\\n(3) Political incentives and rarity of mid-Congress majority flips: Impeachment requires only a simple majority, but Republicans have strong incentives not to impeach a Republican president. While a mid-Congress majority flip via special elections or mass resignations is theoretically possible, it is historically rare and unsupported by current evidence in the provided research. Preparations for a possible post-2026 impeachment if Democrats gain the House are noted (Source 5: Yahoo link reports team preparation), but any action by a new majority would occur in 2027 and thus not resolve this market.\\n\\n• Sources: H.Res.353 introduction and privileged intent (Source 1: Congress.gov; Source 6: GovInfo). Republican control making passage unlikely (Source 7: Newsweek). Background on impeachment efforts and context (Source 3: Wikipedia).\\n• Structural factors: Market’s date constraints, congressional seating schedules, and majority party control dynamics strongly point to No within the specified window.\",\n  \"confidence\": 70,\n  \"confidenceReasoning\": \"(1) Strong structural constraints: Confidence is bolstered by the fixed timing of congressional terms and the market’s end date, which together preclude a newly elected 2026 majority from acting before December 31, 2026. This structural factor is clear and well-understood.\\n\\n(2) Primary-source confirmation of current bill status: Congress.gov and GovInfo (Sources 1 and 6) are high-reliability primary sources confirming H.Res.353’s introduction and current procedural status, indicating no House approval to date and no sign of imminent passage.\\n\\n(3) Remaining uncertainties: Confidence is tempered by potential—but low-probability—paths such as unexpected scandals leading to Republican defections or a rare mid-Congress majority change via special elections. The available research does not provide detailed, verified forecasts of House control shifts or member churn through the end of 2026. Some sources (e.g., Source 5 Yahoo link, Source 2 UCSF page) are of mixed quality or tangential, and the Grok search results are general trend pieces without verifiable, specific evidence.\\n\\n• Net effect: High-quality procedural data and timeline logic drive a No prediction, but incomplete visibility into potential shocks keeps confidence below very high levels.\",\n  \"probability\": 11,\n  \"keyFactors\": [\n    \"The 119th Congress remains in place through December 31, 2026; any 2026 midterm majority change takes effect in January 2027, beyond the market window.\",\n    \"H.Res.353 was introduced and noticed as a privileged resolution but has not been approved; the Republican majority can block or table it (Source 1: Congress.gov; Source 6: GovInfo).\",\n    \"Newsweek reporting indicates Republican control of the House in 2025, making passage of impeachment articles unlikely (Source 7).\",\n    \"Impeachment requires only a simple majority, but partisan incentives strongly disfavor Republicans impeaching a Republican president.\",\n    \"Privileged resolutions can force consideration but not passage; majority party control remains decisive.\",\n    \"Rare possibility of mid-Congress majority flips via special elections or mass defections, but no evidence suggests such a scenario is likely within the window.\",\n    \"Even if Democrats win the 2026 election, they cannot act before the market deadline due to congressional seating schedules.\"\n  ],\n  \"dataQuality\": 78,\n  \"lastUpdated\": \"2025-11-13T12:00:00Z\"\n}",

The sources include a mix like the congress.gov entry for H.Res.353 by a representative, alongside a govinfo entry. However, some links like Yahoo seem broken, and Quora doesn’t apply here. I must weigh the reliability of primary sources more heavily since we know that \"Grok Web Search Results\" might be questionable. I'll be careful in evaluating the data quality while following the guidelines.**Assessing impeachment possibility**\n\nI’m considering whether Trump could be impeached by the end of 2026 based on the House's actions. It could happen if the House approves articles of impeachment between July 24, 2025, and December 31, 2026. This scenario seems possible if Democrats gain control after the 2026 midterms or some Republicans defect. I need to evaluate the House control for the 119th Congress since current research indicates a Republican majority. News articles suggest an impeachment is unlikely, but there has been at least one resolution introduced.**Evaluating impeachment likelihood**\n\nIt seems like there’s a potential floor attempt for impeachment. However, a Republican majority could choose to table or refer it. The probability of a \"yes\" by the end of 2026 primarily hinges on whether Democrats win the House in November 2026 and decide to impeach. Evaluating their chances is tricky without current polling. Historically, midterms often favor the opposition party, making gains likely. I need to keep in mind the time frame from mid-2025 to the end of 2026 and the lame-duck period afterward.**Clarifying congressional timeline**\n\nI need to clarify the timeline regarding the 2026 midterm elections, which will seat members for the 120th Congress starting January 3, 2027. The House elections occur every two years, meaning the current Congress is actually the 119th, and that the new majority wouldn’t take effect until January 3, 2027, after the market period ends on December 31, 2026. If Republicans control the 119th Congress through 2025-2026, an impeachment vote seems highly unlikely. It's crucial to verify this assumption about House seats and the timing.**Analyzing impeachment odds**\n\nThe current Congress is the 119th, running from January 3, 2025, to January 3, 2027. The market ends on December 31, 2026, before the new majority is seated. This means that any impeachment vote will occur under a Republican-controlled House, making impeachment unlikely by that date. Additionally, even if Democrats win in 2026, they won’t have the majority until January 2027, outside the market's timeframe. I should clarify these key factors and cite relevant sources.",
