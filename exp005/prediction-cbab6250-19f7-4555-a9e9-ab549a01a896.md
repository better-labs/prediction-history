# Will Oscar Piastri be the 2025 Drivers Champion?

## **AI Prediction Delta: 0.25%**

## AI Prediction Overview

- **Market Prediction:** [67.75%](https://polymarket.com/event/f1-drivers-champion/will-oscar-piastri-be-the-2025-drivers-champion)
- **AI Prediction:** 68%
- **Confidence:** 72%

### Key Factors
- Current 16-point championship lead over Norris and 81-point lead over Verstappen
- McLaren's clear car superiority - described as 'best' on grid with three consecutive 1-2 finishes
- Piastri's superior composure and mistake-free driving compared to Norris's error-prone performances
- Strong recent form with multiple wins and consistent podiums throughout 2025
- Verstappen's decline with only one podium in last six races, effectively eliminating Red Bull from contention
- Piastri's rapid development trajectory - found the 'extra tenth' to match/exceed Norris pace
- Historical precedent of Australian drivers (Brabham, Jones) winning WDC in years they achieved 5 GP wins
- Team dynamics favoring championship leader if gap is maintained
- Remaining season length allowing for potential momentum shifts or reliability issues
- Mental strength advantage in high-pressure championship battles

### Outcome Reasoning
(1) CURRENT CHAMPIONSHIP POSITION AND MOMENTUM

Oscar Piastri holds a commanding position in the 2025 championship with a 16-point lead over teammate Lando Norris and an 81-point advantage over Max Verstappen (Source: Planet F1, July 31, 2025). This substantial gap, particularly over Verstappen, effectively reduces the championship to a two-horse race between the McLaren drivers, as Piastri himself acknowledged.

Piastri's recent form has been exceptional, with two wins in four races early in the season (Autosport, April 2025) and continuing dominance through mid-season, including a crucial victory at Spa that extended his lead (Planet F1, July 2025). McLaren has achieved three consecutive one-two finishes, demonstrating overwhelming car superiority.

(2) PERFORMANCE TRAJECTORY AND DRIVER DEVELOPMENT

Piastri's development curve has exceeded expectations. Multiple sources note he has found the "extra tenth" needed to match or exceed Norris's pace (TenTenths forum, June 2025). In 2024, he finished 4th in the championship in only his second F1 season, and the gap to Norris narrowed from 108 points in 2023 to just 82 points in 2024 - despite racing with a broken rib for half the season.

By June 2025, Piastri had already matched legendary Australian drivers Jack Brabham and Alan Jones by winning 5 Grand Prix in a single season - both of whom won the WDC in their respective 5-win seasons (TenTenths forum). This historical parallel provides a compelling precedent.

(3) COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES OVER KEY RIVALS

• **vs. Lando Norris**: Piastri demonstrates superior composure under pressure. Multiple sources cite his "mistake-free" driving and ability to remain "completely unflappable" (TenTenths forum). Norris has been described as "mistake prone" in 2025, repeating patterns from 2024 (Quora analysis). Piastri's calm demeanor is seen as a decisive advantage in championship battles.

• **vs. Max Verstappen**: Red Bull's competitive decline is evident - Verstappen has managed only one podium in his last six races (Planet F1). With an 81-point deficit and McLaren's clear car superiority, Verstappen is effectively out of contention.

(4) TEAM DYNAMICS AND STRATEGIC POSITION

McLaren possesses the "best" car on the grid (Planet F1, Piastri's own assessment). If Piastri maintains his lead, McLaren will likely prioritize his championship bid, as suggested by historical precedent and team strategy considerations (Quora analysis). The team has already shown willingness to manage driver positions strategically.

(5) REMAINING SEASON OUTLOOK

With approximately half the season remaining (July update), Piastri's 16-point lead over Norris provides a comfortable but not insurmountable margin. However, his consistency, superior pressure management, and the car advantage make him the favorite. Betting markets reflect this, with Piastri at 41.7% implied probability versus Norris at 38.1% (Quora, May 2025 odds) - though his position has likely strengthened since then.

### Confidence Reasoning
(1) DATA RECENCY AND RELIABILITY ASSESSMENT

The research data spans from April to July 2025, providing current season insights. However, a critical limitation exists: the most recent data is from July 31, 2025, and we're now analyzing a championship that extends through the full season (likely ending in November-December 2025). This temporal gap of several months means significant developments could have occurred that aren't reflected in the available data.

The sources include reputable F1 media (Autosport, Planet F1) and direct quotes from Piastri himself, providing high-quality primary information. However, forum discussions (TenTenths, Quora) while insightful, represent opinion rather than verified facts.

(2) UNCERTAINTY FACTORS AFFECTING CONFIDENCE

• **Remaining races**: With potentially 8-10 races remaining after July, there's substantial opportunity for momentum shifts, mechanical failures, or strategic errors that could alter the championship outcome.

• **Norris's capability**: The 16-point gap is relatively small in F1 terms. Norris has proven speed and could capitalize on any Piastri mistakes or reliability issues. The championship battle between teammates adds unpredictability.

• **External variables**: Weather conditions, safety car timing, potential regulation changes, or reliability issues could dramatically impact results. The research doesn't provide data on comparative reliability between the McLaren drivers.

• **Historical precedent limitations**: While the Brabham/Jones parallel is interesting, it's based on only two data points and may not be statistically significant.

(3) CONFIDENCE LEVEL JUSTIFICATION

The 72% confidence reflects:

**Supporting factors (increase confidence)**:
- Strong current championship position (16-point lead)
- Clear car superiority over rivals
- Demonstrated performance improvement and consistency
- Superior mental composure under pressure
- Verstappen effectively eliminated from contention
- Positive momentum and recent race wins

**Limiting factors (decrease confidence)**:
- Significant time gap in available data (July to season end)
- Close points battle with capable teammate
- Inherent unpredictability of F1 racing
- Lack of mechanical reliability data
- No information on potential car development trajectories

The confidence level stops short of 80%+ due to the incomplete season data and the inherent volatility of F1 championships, particularly in close teammate battles.

- Since letting his [McLaren](https://www.autosport.com/team/mclaren/36473/) slide off the track on lap 44 in Melbourne and losing a lot of points, [Oscar Piastri](https://www.autosport.com/driver/oscar-piastri/869530/) has been almost flawless. Two victories, in Shanghai and Bahrain, and a third place in Suzuka allowed him to regain almost everything he lost in the Formula 1 season opener. Piastri now sits just three points behind his team-mate and the driver who'd been tipped to win the title before the season began.
- In another life Oscar Piastri’s manager, [Mark Webber](https://www.autosport.com/driver/mark-webber/829924/), had a mathematical chance of being a world champion but his team preferred the driver in the other car. Webber was seven points ahead of team-mate [Sebastian Vettel](https://www.autosport.com/driver/sebastian-vettel/829234/) going into the 2010 season finale but Vettel was always Red Bull’s favoured son. Webber never got as close to the title again and his relationship with the team soured.

## Source 2: How likely is it that Lando Norris could finish outside the top 2 in the 2025 Drivers' Championship given how well Oscar Piastri is doing?
URL: https://www.quora.com/How-likely-is-it-that-Lando-Norris-could-finish-outside-the-top-2-in-the-2025-Drivers-Championship-given-how-well-Oscar-Piastri-is-doing

### Summary
Oscar Piastri is currently favored to win the 2025 Drivers' Championship, with betting odds placing him at 41.7% likelihood, compared to Lando Norris at 38.1% and Max Verstappen at 23.1%. Piastri's impressive performance in 2024, where he consistently contended for wins and finished 4th in the championship, indicates a strong trajectory. His calm demeanor under pressure is seen as an advantage over Norris, who has been prone to mistakes. If Piastri can establish a lead early in the season, McLaren may prioritize his championship bid, making him a serious contender for the title. Overall, the 2025 season is shaping up to be highly competitive, particularly between Piastri and Norris.

### Key Highlights
- How likely is it that Lando Norris could finish outside the top 2 in the 2025 Drivers' Championship given how well Oscar Piastri is doing? Too early to tell, but certainly possible. Media thought his 2024 blunders would teach him what he needs to do to win the World Championship, but so far in 2025 he seems to be the same old mistake prone Lando. Given that his teammate Piastri is looking rock solid and Max simply doesn’t make mistakes, as long as the RedBull remains decent it’s quite likely Max and Oscar will fight for the gold while Norris is left behind.
- And of course, being too early we don’t know how much can Mercedes and Ferrari progress. Lewis is not a factor, but Russell and Leclerc could become contenders given the right car. Do you think Oscar Piastri can shift the balance of power McLaren away from Lando Norris? Oscar Piastri could definitely be favoured above Lando Norris, and I think 2025 may be the year we see that transition.
- What are the chances that Oscar (and McLaren) win the 2025 Formula 1 championship over Max and Lando? The bookies have the odds currently (28th May 2025) as follows; Oscar Piastri 7/5 (41.7%) Lando Norris 13/8 (38.1%) Max Verstappen (23.1%) The figures in brackets are the implied percentage chance for each driver winning the title this season. So yes, Oscar is favourite and rightly so as things stand, Norris second favourite and then Verstappen third, no other driver has a realistic chance of winning the title as things stand.

Oscar Piastri could definitely be favoured above Lando Norris, and I think 2025 may be the year we see that transition. 2024 was Oscar’s 2nd year in F1, but at almost every race, he was a contender for a win. Admittedly, 2024 was the first year that Lando also had a competitive car, but Piastri’s rate of development in F1 has been incredible. At the end of 2023, Oscar finished 9th in the World Drivers Championship, and in 2024 he finished 4th. When comparing the points between Norris and Piastri, in 2023 Norris bettered Piastri by 108 points, and in 2024 by 82 points; keeping in mind that Oscar let Lando by on a few occasions and that he had a broken rib for the first half of the season. With this rate of progress, 2025 should be a tight battle, but I think Oscar will come out on top. Mainly because he’s a lot more cool headed than Norris is, so I think he will absorb the pressure of fighting for the championship much better than his team mate will. Many, including Sebastian Vettel have tipped him to become the first Australian WDC since Alan Jones in the 1980. The key lies in how he starts the season. If he can draw a decent margin to Lando at th

URL: https://tentenths.com/forum/showthread.php?s=a93b664f41f812815454193e748ae451&p=4257183
Published: 2025-06-17T00:00:00.000Z

### Summary
Oscar Piastri is emerging as a strong contender for the 2025 Formula 1 World Drivers' Championship (WDC). As of June 2025, he has matched the achievements of legendary Australian drivers by winning five Grands Prix in a single season, with the potential to become the first Aussie to secure six wins. This historical context suggests a promising trajectory for Piastri, as both Jack Brabham and Alan Jones won the WDC in the years they achieved five wins.

Discussion among forum members highlights Piastri's remarkable improvement and competitiveness, particularly against his teammate Lando Norris. Initially, some doubted Piastri's ability to outperform Norris, but recent performances indicate he has found the speed needed to be a championship favorite. His consistency and ability to handle pressure have also been noted, with one user praising his mistake-free driving and strong qualifying performances.

Overall, the sentiment in the forum leans towards optimism regarding Piastri's chances of becoming the 2025 Drivers' Champion, especially if he maintains his current form and continues to capitalize on opportunities throughout the season.

### Key Highlights
- Joins Jack Brabham (1960) and Alan Jones (1980) as the only Aussies to win 5 GPs in a season..... one more win this year and he becomes the only Aussie to win 6 GP's in a season. Oh and of course both AJ and JB won the WDC title in the year they got 5 wins, which has to be a decent omen.  Piastri has the potential to be world champion in the right car, but I can’t see it happening while Norris is his teammate.
- Norris is just that little bit faster than him and while Piastri is still inexperienced and can improve, I can’t see him ever gaining that tenth or so.  This could turn out to be one of my worst F1 takes. I didn’t believe for a second Piastri would ever beat Norris over a season before 2025, but he really has found that extra tenth and is now absolutely the championship favourite.
- If his qualifying performance hold-up, he is looking very strong.  Oscar is already faster than Lando. And has more wins than Lando in F1 despite a few years less experience. he will win the whole thing next year. make my words. He’s already one of the top 3 drivers on the grid and with McLaren improving it will be a piece of cake. ?  It's too bad that FAS33 couldn't tone himself down and not get the boot from the forum to see his prediction (potentially) come true.

 Very modest BTCC frog but most of our predictions wouldn't stand up well in hindsight. 
What gets me is he makes almost no mistakes and is completely unflappable. The SC yesterday was in many ways unfair given he had dominated the race. But no dramas, he quickly carved out the no-DRS buffer and that was that. 
If his qualifying performance hold-up, he is looking very strong.

### Summary
Oscar Piastri has expressed confidence in his chances of becoming the 2025 F1 Drivers' Champion, particularly as he views the title race as increasingly focused on himself and his McLaren teammate, Lando Norris. With Max Verstappen now 81 points behind and struggling to maintain competitive form, Piastri believes the championship battle will primarily be between him and Norris, given McLaren's dominance this season. Piastri has highlighted his recent performances, including a victory at Spa, and is focused on maintaining consistency to secure his first World Championship.

### Key Highlights
- **Oscar Piastri admits that the F1 2025 Drivers’ Championship battle is now likely to come down to a straight fight between him and McLaren team-mate Lando Norris. ** With nearest challenger Max Verstappen having fallen 81 points off top spot, championship leader [Piastri](https://www.planetf1.com/driver/oscar-piastri/results) is now looking to McLaren team-mate Norris as his main challenger for the crown as they battle it out in the “best” car on the grid.

Oscar Piastri admits Max Verstappen is likely out of the title race

**Oscar Piastri admits that the F1 2025 Drivers’ Championship battle is now likely to come down to a straight fight between him and McLaren team-mate Lando Norris.**

With nearest challenger Max Verstappen having fallen 81 points off top spot, championship leader [Piastri](https://www.planetf1.com/driver/oscar-piastri/results) is now looking to McLaren team-mate Norris as his main challenger for the crown as they battle it out in the “best” car on the grid.

## Max Verstappen out of F1 2025 title running?

_Additional reporting by Thomas Maher_

McLaren has kicked on impressively from their 2024 Constructors’ Championship win to become the clear standard of F1 2025, though for a time reigning four-time World Champion Verstappen was keeping himself in the title hunt at the wheel of the Red Bull RB21.

But with just one podium finish in his last six grands prix, Verstappen’s chances have dwindled with McLaren on a run of three consecutive one-two results.

Piastri blunted Norris’ momentum with victory at Spa, extending his lead to 16 points, and ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix, he was asked if he now considers this [title fight](https://www.planetf1.com/standings) a two-horse race between the McLaren drivers.

“I suppose so,” he confirmed.

“I think every weekend now, or the last few weekends anyway, it’s been Lando and I.

“I expect our competition to still be strong and put up a good fight, especially at certain tracks through the rest of the year, but whether that comes from Max or Ferrari or Mercedes or someone else, maybe, we never really know.

“So, I’m not too concerned about what happens in that. I’m just trying to win each race and extend the lead.

“But I think clearly Lando and I are in the same car, which is the best, and he’s naturally going to be the closest competition.”

[Share on Viber](viber://forward?text=https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/f1-panel-is-oscar-piastri-now-the-title-favourite/10713615/)\n- Since letting his [McLaren](https://www.autosport.com/team/mclaren/36473/) slide off the track on lap 44 in Melbourne and losing a lot of points, [Oscar Piastri](https://www.autosport.com/driver/oscar-piastri/869530/) has been almost flawless. Two victories, in Shanghai and Bahrain, and a third place in Suzuka allowed him to regain almost everything he lost in the Formula 1 season opener. Piastri now sits just three points behind his team-mate and the driver who'd been tipped to win the title before the season began.\n- In another life Oscar Piastri’s manager, [Mark Webber](https://www.autosport.com/driver/mark-webber/829924/), had a mathematical chance of being a world champion but his team preferred the driver in the other car. Webber was seven points ahead of team-mate [Sebastian Vettel](https://www.autosport.com/driver/sebastian-vettel/829234/) going into the 2010 season finale but Vettel was always Red Bull’s favoured son.

Piastri's impressive performance in 2024, where he consistently contended for wins and finished 4th in the championship, indicates a strong trajectory. His calm demeanor under pressure is seen as an advantage over Norris, who has been prone to mistakes. If Piastri can establish a lead early in the season, McLaren may prioritize his championship bid, making him a serious contender for the title. Overall, the 2025 season is shaping up to be highly competitive, particularly between Piastri and Norris.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- How likely is it that Lando Norris could finish outside the top 2 in the 2025 Drivers' Championship given how well Oscar Piastri is doing? Too early to tell, but certainly possible. Media thought his 2024 blunders would teach him what he needs to do to win the World Championship, but so far in 2025 he seems to be the same old mistake prone Lando. Given that his teammate Piastri is looking rock solid and Max simply doesn’t make mistakes, as long as the RedBull remains decent it’s quite likely Max and Oscar will fight for the gold while Norris is left behind.\n- And of course, being too early we don’t know how much can Mercedes and Ferrari progress. Lewis is not a factor, but Russell and Leclerc could become contenders given the right car. Do you think Oscar Piastri can shift the balance of power McLaren away from Lando Norris? Oscar Piastri could definitely be favoured above Lando Norris, and I think 2025 may be the year we see that transition.\n- What are the chances that Oscar (and McLaren) win the 2025 Formula 1 championship over Max and Lando? The bookies have the odds currently (28th May 2025) as follows; Oscar Piastri 7/5 (41.7%) Lando Norris 13/8 (38.1%) Max Verstappen (23.1%) The figures in brackets are the implied percentage chance for each driver winning the title this season. So yes, Oscar is favourite and rightly so as things stand, Norris second favourite and then Verstappen third, no other driver has a realistic chance of winning the title as things stand.\n\n### Content\nHow likely is it that Lando Norris could finish outside the top 2 in the 2025 Drivers' Championship given how well Oscar Piastri is doing?

Do you think Oscar Piastri can shift the balance of power McLaren away from Lando Norris? Oscar Piastri could definitely be favoured above Lando Norris, and I think 2025 may be the year we see that transition. 2024 was Oscar’s 2nd year in F1, but at almost every race, he was a contender for a win. Admittedly, 2024 was the first year that Lando also had a competitive car, but Piastri’s rate of development in F1 has been incredible. At the end of 2023, Oscar finished 9th in the World Drivers Championship, and in 2024 he finished 4th. When comparing the points between Norris and Piastri, in 2023 Norris bettered Piastri by 108 points, and in 2024 by 82 points; keeping in mind that Oscar let Lando by on a few occasions and that he had a broken rib for the first half of the season. With this rate of progress, 2025 should be a tight battle, but I think Oscar will come out on top. Mainly because he’s a lot more cool headed than Norris is, so I think he will absorb the pressure of fighting for the championship much better than his team mate will. Many, including Sebastian Vettel have tipped him to become the first Australian WDC since Alan Jones in the 1980. The key lies in how he starts the season. If he can draw a decent margin to Lando at th\n\n---\n\n## Source 3: Why Oscar Piastri will win the WDC in 2025 - Page 4\nURL: https://tentenths.com/forum/showthread.php?s=a93b664f41f812815454193e748ae451&p=4257183\nPublished: 2025-06-17T00:00:00.000Z\n\n### Summary\nOscar Piastri is emerging as a strong contender for the 2025 Formula 1 World Drivers' Championship (WDC). As of June 2025, he has matched the achievements of legendary Australian drivers by winning five Grands Prix in a single season, with the potential to become the first Aussie to secure six wins. This historical context suggests a promising trajectory for Piastri, as both Jack Brabham and Alan Jones won the WDC in the years they achieved five wins.\n\nDiscussion among forum members highlights Piastri's remarkable improvement and competitiveness, particularly against his teammate Lando Norris. Initially, some doubted Piastri's ability to outperform Norris, but recent performances indicate he has found the speed needed to be a championship favorite. His consistency and ability to handle pressure have also been noted, with one user praising his mistake-free driving and strong qualifying performances.\n\nOverall, the sentiment in the forum leans towards optimism regarding Piastri's chances of becoming the 2025 Drivers' Champion, especially if he maintains his current form and continues to capitalize on opportunities throughout the season.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Joins Jack Brabham (1960) and Alan Jones (1980) as the only Aussies to win 5 GPs in a season..... one more win this year and he becomes the only Aussie to win 6 GP's in a season. Oh and of course both AJ and JB won the WDC title in the year they got 5 wins, which has to be a decent omen.  Piastri has the potential to be world champion in the right car, but I can’t see it happening while Norris is his teammate.\n- Norris is just that little bit faster than him and while Piastri is still inexperienced and can improve, I can’t see him ever gaining that tenth or so.  This could turn out to be one of my worst F1 takes. I didn’t believe for a second Piastri would ever beat Norris over a season before 2025, but he really has found that extra tenth and is now absolutely the championship favourite.\n- If his qualifying performance hold-up, he is looking very strong.  Oscar is already faster than Lando. And has more wins than Lando in F1 despite a few years less experience. he will win the whole thing next year. make my words. He’s already one of the top 3 drivers on the grid and with McLaren improving it will be a piece of cake. ?  It's too bad that FAS33 couldn't tone himself down and not get the boot from the forum to see his prediction (potentially) come true.\n\n### Content\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1 Jun 2025, 21:03 (Ref:4256767)\n \n \n  \n # 76 \n \n \n \n \n \n Veteran \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n Joins Jack Brabham (1960) and Alan Jones (1980) as the only Aussies to win 5 GPs in a season..... one more win this year and he becomes the only Aussie to win 6 GP's in a season. \nOh and of course both AJ and JB won the WDC title in the year they got 5 wins, which has to be a decent omen.\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2 Jun 2025, 08:53 (Ref:4256799)\n \n \n  \n # 77 \n \n \n \n \n \n Veteran \n \n   \n \n \n  \n Join Date: Nov 2020 \n \n Posts: 1,179\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Quote: \n \n \n Originally Posted by BTCC frog \n \n \n Piastri has the potential to be world champion in the right car, but I can’t see it happening while Norris is his teammate.

This substantial gap, particularly over Verstappen, effectively reduces the championship to a two-horse race between the McLaren drivers, as Piastri himself acknowledged.\\n\\nPiastri's recent form has been exceptional, with two wins in four races early in the season (Autosport, April 2025) and continuing dominance through mid-season, including a crucial victory at Spa that extended his lead (Planet F1, July 2025). McLaren has achieved three consecutive one-two finishes, demonstrating overwhelming car superiority.\\n\\n(2) PERFORMANCE TRAJECTORY AND DRIVER DEVELOPMENT\\n\\nPiastri's development curve has exceeded expectations. Multiple sources note he has found the \\\"extra tenth\\\" needed to match or exceed Norris's pace (TenTenths forum, June 2025). In 2024, he finished 4th in the championship in only his second F1 season, and the gap to Norris narrowed from 108 points in 2023 to just 82 points in 2024 - despite racing with a broken rib for half the season.\\n\\nBy June 2025, Piastri had already matched legendary Australian drivers Jack Brabham and Alan Jones by winning 5 Grand Prix in a single season - both of whom won the WDC in their respective 5-win seasons (TenTenths forum). This historical parallel provides a compelling precedent.\\n\\n(3) COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES OVER KEY RIVALS\\n\\n• **vs. Lando Norris**: Piastri demonstrates superior composure under pressure. Multiple sources cite his \\\"mistake-free\\\" driving and ability to remain \\\"completely unflappable\\\" (TenTenths forum). Norris has been described as \\\"mistake prone\\\" in 2025, repeating patterns from 2024 (Quora analysis). Piastri's calm demeanor is seen as a decisive advantage in championship battles.\\n\\n• **vs. Max Verstappen**: Red Bull's competitive decline is evident - Verstappen has managed only one podium in his last six races (Planet F1). With an 81-point deficit and McLaren's clear car superiority, Verstappen is effectively out of contention.\\n\\n(4) TEAM DYNAMICS AND STRATEGIC POSITION\\n\\nMcLaren possesses the \\\"best\\\" car on the grid (Planet F1, Piastri's own assessment). If Piastri maintains his lead, McLaren will likely prioritize his championship bid, as suggested by historical precedent and team strategy considerations (Quora analysis). The team has already shown willingness to manage driver positions strategically.\\n\\n(5) REMAINING SEASON OUTLOOK\\n\\nWith approximately half the season remaining (July update), Piastri's 16-point lead over Norris provides a comfortable but not insurmountable margin. However, his consistency, superior pressure management, and the car advantage make him the favorite.

      "outcomeReasoning": "(1) CURRENT CHAMPIONSHIP POSITION AND MOMENTUM\n\nOscar Piastri holds a commanding position in the 2025 championship with a 16-point lead over teammate Lando Norris and an 81-point advantage over Max Verstappen (Source: Planet F1, July 31, 2025). This substantial gap, particularly over Verstappen, effectively reduces the championship to a two-horse race between the McLaren drivers, as Piastri himself acknowledged.\n\nPiastri's recent form has been exceptional, with two wins in four races early in the season (Autosport, April 2025) and continuing dominance through mid-season, including a crucial victory at Spa that extended his lead (Planet F1, July 2025). McLaren has achieved three consecutive one-two finishes, demonstrating overwhelming car superiority.\n\n(2) PERFORMANCE TRAJECTORY AND DRIVER DEVELOPMENT\n\nPiastri's development curve has exceeded expectations. Multiple sources note he has found the \"extra tenth\" needed to match or exceed Norris's pace (TenTenths forum, June 2025). In 2024, he finished 4th in the championship in only his second F1 season, and the gap to Norris narrowed from 108 points in 2023 to just 82 points in 2024 - despite racing with a broken rib for half the season.\n\nBy June 2025, Piastri had already matched legendary Australian drivers Jack Brabham and Alan Jones by winning 5 Grand Prix in a single season - both of whom won the WDC in their respective 5-win seasons (TenTenths forum). This historical parallel provides a compelling precedent.\n\n(3) COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES OVER KEY RIVALS\n\n• **vs. Lando Norris**: Piastri demonstrates superior composure under pressure. Multiple sources cite his \"mistake-free\" driving and ability to remain \"completely unflappable\" (TenTenths forum). Norris has been described as \"mistake prone\" in 2025, repeating patterns from 2024 (Quora analysis). Piastri's calm demeanor is seen as a decisive advantage in championship battles.\n\n• **vs. Max Verstappen**: Red Bull's competitive decline is evident - Verstappen has managed only one podium in his last six races (Planet F1). With an 81-point deficit and McLaren's clear car superiority, Verstappen is effectively out of contention.\n\n(4) TEAM DYNAMICS AND STRATEGIC POSITION\n\nMcLaren possesses the \"best\" car on the grid (Planet F1, Piastri's own assessment). If Piastri maintains his lead, McLaren will likely prioritize his championship bid, as suggested by historical precedent and team strategy considerations (Quora analysis). The team has already shown willingness to manage driver positions strategically.\n\n(5) REMAINING SEASON OUTLOOK\n\nWith approximately half the season remaining (July update), Piastri's 16-point lead over Norris provides a comfortable but not insurmountable margin. However, his consistency, superior pressure management, and the car advantage make him the favorite. Betting markets reflect this, with Piastri at 41.7% implied probability versus Norris at 38.1% (Quora, May 2025 odds) - though his position has likely strengthened since then.",
      "confidenceReasoning": "(1) DATA RECENCY AND RELIABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe research data spans from April to July 2025, providing current season insights.

[Share on Viber](viber://forward?text=https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/f1-panel-is-oscar-piastri-now-the-title-favourite/10713615/)\n- Since letting his [McLaren](https://www.autosport.com/team/mclaren/36473/) slide off the track on lap 44 in Melbourne and losing a lot of points, [Oscar Piastri](https://www.autosport.com/driver/oscar-piastri/869530/) has been almost flawless.

Piastri's impressive performance in 2024, where he consistently contended for wins and finished 4th in the championship, indicates a strong trajectory. His calm demeanor under pressure is seen as an advantage over Norris, who has been prone to mistakes. If Piastri can establish a lead early in the season, McLaren may prioritize his championship bid, making him a serious contender for the title. Overall, the 2025 season is shaping up to be highly competitive, particularly between Piastri and Norris.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- How likely is it that Lando Norris could finish outside the top 2 in the 2025 Drivers' Championship given how well Oscar Piastri is doing? Too early to tell, but certainly possible. Media thought his 2024 blunders would teach him what he needs to do to win the World Championship, but so far in 2025 he seems to be the same old mistake prone Lando. Given that his teammate Piastri is looking rock solid and Max simply doesn’t make mistakes, as long as the RedBull remains decent it’s quite likely Max and Oscar will fight for the gold while Norris is left behind.\n- And of course, being too early we don’t know how much can Mercedes and Ferrari progress. Lewis is not a factor, but Russell and Leclerc could become contenders given the right car. Do you think Oscar Piastri can shift the balance of power McLaren away from Lando Norris? Oscar Piastri could definitely be favoured above Lando Norris, and I think 2025 may be the year we see that transition.\n- What are the chances that Oscar (and McLaren) win the 2025 Formula 1 championship over Max and Lando? The bookies have the odds currently (28th May 2025) as follows; Oscar Piastri 7/5 (41.7%) Lando Norris 13/8 (38.1%) Max Verstappen (23.1%) The figures in brackets are the implied percentage chance for each driver winning the title this season. So yes, Oscar is favourite and rightly so as things stand, Norris second favourite and then Verstappen third, no other driver has a realistic chance of winning the title as things stand.\n\n### Content\nHow likely is it that Lando Norris could finish outside the top 2 in the 2025 Drivers' Championship given how well Oscar Piastri is doing?

Do you think Oscar Piastri can shift the balance of power McLaren away from Lando Norris? Oscar Piastri could definitely be favoured above Lando Norris, and I think 2025 may be the year we see that transition. 2024 was Oscar’s 2nd year in F1, but at almost every race, he was a contender for a win. Admittedly, 2024 was the first year that Lando also had a competitive car, but Piastri’s rate of development in F1 has been incredible. At the end of 2023, Oscar finished 9th in the World Drivers Championship, and in 2024 he finished 4th. When comparing the points between Norris and Piastri, in 2023 Norris bettered Piastri by 108 points, and in 2024 by 82 points; keeping in mind that Oscar let Lando by on a few occasions and that he had a broken rib for the first half of the season. With this rate of progress, 2025 should be a tight battle, but I think Oscar will come out on top. Mainly because he’s a lot more cool headed than Norris is, so I think he will absorb the pressure of fighting for the championship much better than his team mate will. Many, including Sebastian Vettel have tipped him to become the first Australian WDC since Alan Jones in the 1980. The key lies in how he starts the season. If he can draw a decent margin to Lando at th\n\n---\n\n## Source 3: Why Oscar Piastri will win the WDC in 2025 - Page 4\nURL: https://tentenths.com/forum/showthread.php?s=a93b664f41f812815454193e748ae451&p=4257183\nPublished: 2025-06-17T00:00:00.000Z\n\n### Summary\nOscar Piastri is emerging as a strong contender for the 2025 Formula 1 World Drivers' Championship (WDC). As of June 2025, he has matched the achievements of legendary Australian drivers by winning five Grands Prix in a single season, with the potential to become the first Aussie to secure six wins. This historical context suggests a promising trajectory for Piastri, as both Jack Brabham and Alan Jones won the WDC in the years they achieved five wins.\n\nDiscussion among forum members highlights Piastri's remarkable improvement and competitiveness, particularly against his teammate Lando Norris. Initially, some doubted Piastri's ability to outperform Norris, but recent performances indicate he has found the speed needed to be a championship favorite. His consistency and ability to handle pressure have also been noted, with one user praising his mistake-free driving and strong qualifying performances.\n\nOverall, the sentiment in the forum leans towards optimism regarding Piastri's chances of becoming the 2025 Drivers' Champion, especially if he maintains his current form and continues to capitalize on opportunities throughout the season.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Joins Jack Brabham (1960) and Alan Jones (1980) as the only Aussies to win 5 GPs in a season..... one more win this year and he becomes the only Aussie to win 6 GP's in a season. Oh and of course both AJ and JB won the WDC title in the year they got 5 wins, which has to be a decent omen.  Piastri has the potential to be world champion in the right car, but I can’t see it happening while Norris is his teammate.\n- Norris is just that little bit faster than him and while Piastri is still inexperienced and can improve, I can’t see him ever gaining that tenth or so.  This could turn out to be one of my worst F1 takes. I didn’t believe for a second Piastri would ever beat Norris over a season before 2025, but he really has found that extra tenth and is now absolutely the championship favourite.\n- If his qualifying performance hold-up, he is looking very strong.  Oscar is already faster than Lando. And has more wins than Lando in F1 despite a few years less experience. he will win the whole thing next year. make my words.

With Max Verstappen now 81 points behind and struggling to maintain competitive form, Piastri believes the championship battle will primarily be between him and Norris, given McLaren's dominance this season. Piastri has highlighted his recent performances, including a victory at Spa, and is focused on maintaining consistency to secure his first World Championship.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- **Oscar Piastri admits that the F1 2025 Drivers’ Championship battle is now likely to come down to a straight fight between him and McLaren team-mate Lando Norris. ** With nearest challenger Max Verstappen having fallen 81 points off top spot, championship leader [Piastri](https://www.planetf1.com/driver/oscar-piastri/results) is now looking to McLaren team-mate Norris as his main challenger for the crown as they battle it out in the “best” car on the grid.\n- McLaren has kicked on impressively from their 2024 Constructors’ Championship win to become the clear standard of F1 2025, though for a time reigning four-time World Champion Verstappen was keeping himself in the title hunt at the wheel of the Red Bull RB21. But with just one podium finish in his last six grands prix, Verstappen’s chances have dwindled with McLaren on a run of three consecutive one-two results.\n- Piastri blunted Norris’ momentum with victory at Spa, extending his lead to 16 points, and ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix, he was asked if he now considers this [title fight](https://www.planetf1.com/standings) a two-horse race between the McLaren drivers. “I expect our competition to still be strong and put up a good fight, especially at certain tracks through the rest of the year, but whether that comes from Max or Ferrari or Mercedes or someone else, maybe, we never really know.\n\n### Content\nOscar Piastri admits Max Verstappen is likely out of the title race\n\n**Oscar Piastri admits that the F1 2025 Drivers’ Championship battle is now likely to come down to a straight fight between him and McLaren team-mate Lando Norris.**\n\nWith nearest challenger Max Verstappen having fallen 81 points off top spot, championship leader [Piastri](https://www.planetf1.com/driver/oscar-piastri/results) is now looking to McLaren team-mate Norris as his main challenger for the crown as they battle it out in the “best” car on the grid.\n\n## Max Verstappen out of F1 2025 title running?\n\n_Additional reporting by Thomas Maher_\n\nMcLaren has kicked on impressively from their 2024 Constructors’ Championship win to become the clear standard of F1 2025, though for a time reigning four-time World Champion Verstappen was keeping himself in the title hunt at the wheel of the Red Bull RB21.\n\nBut with just one podium finish in his last six grands prix, Verstappen’s chances have dwindled with McLaren on a run of three consecutive one-two results.\n\nPiastri blunted Norris’ momentum with victory at Spa, extending his lead to 16 points, and ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix, he was asked if he now considers this [title fight](https://www.planetf1.com/standings) a two-horse race between the McLaren drivers.\n\n“I suppose so,” he confirmed.\n\n“I think every weekend now, or the last few weekends anyway, it’s been Lando and I.\n\n“I expect our competition to still be strong and put up a good fight, especially at certain tracks through the rest of the year, but whether that comes from Max or Ferrari or Mercedes or someone else, maybe, we never really know.\n\n“So, I’m not too concerned about what happens in that.

This substantial gap, particularly over Verstappen, effectively reduces the championship to a two-horse race between the McLaren drivers, as Piastri himself acknowledged.\\n\\nPiastri's recent form has been exceptional, with two wins in four races early in the season (Autosport, April 2025) and continuing dominance through mid-season, including a crucial victory at Spa that extended his lead (Planet F1, July 2025). McLaren has achieved three consecutive one-two finishes, demonstrating overwhelming car superiority.\\n\\n(2) PERFORMANCE TRAJECTORY AND DRIVER DEVELOPMENT\\n\\nPiastri's development curve has exceeded expectations. Multiple sources note he has found the \\\"extra tenth\\\" needed to match or exceed Norris's pace (TenTenths forum, June 2025). In 2024, he finished 4th in the championship in only his second F1 season, and the gap to Norris narrowed from 108 points in 2023 to just 82 points in 2024 - despite racing with a broken rib for half the season.\\n\\nBy June 2025, Piastri had already matched legendary Australian drivers Jack Brabham and Alan Jones by winning 5 Grand Prix in a single season - both of whom won the WDC in their respective 5-win seasons (TenTenths forum). This historical parallel provides a compelling precedent.\\n\\n(3) COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES OVER KEY RIVALS\\n\\n• **vs. Lando Norris**: Piastri demonstrates superior composure under pressure. Multiple sources cite his \\\"mistake-free\\\" driving and ability to remain \\\"completely unflappable\\\" (TenTenths forum). Norris has been described as \\\"mistake prone\\\" in 2025, repeating patterns from 2024 (Quora analysis). Piastri's calm demeanor is seen as a decisive advantage in championship battles.\\n\\n• **vs. Max Verstappen**: Red Bull's competitive decline is evident - Verstappen has managed only one podium in his last six races (Planet F1). With an 81-point deficit and McLaren's clear car superiority, Verstappen is effectively out of contention.\\n\\n(4) TEAM DYNAMICS AND STRATEGIC POSITION\\n\\nMcLaren possesses the \\\"best\\\" car on the grid (Planet F1, Piastri's own assessment). If Piastri maintains his lead, McLaren will likely prioritize his championship bid, as suggested by historical precedent and team strategy considerations (Quora analysis). The team has already shown willingness to manage driver positions strategically.\\n\\n(5) REMAINING SEASON OUTLOOK\\n\\nWith approximately half the season remaining (July update), Piastri's 16-point lead over Norris provides a comfortable but not insurmountable margin. However, his consistency, superior pressure management, and the car advantage make him the favorite. Betting markets reflect this, with Piastri at 41.7% implied probability versus Norris at 38.1% (Quora, May 2025 odds) - though his position has likely strengthened since then.\",\n    \"confidence\": 72,\n    \"confidenceReasoning\": \"(1) DATA RECENCY AND RELIABILITY ASSESSMENT\\n\\nThe research data spans from April to July 2025, providing current season insights. However, a critical limitation exists: the most recent data is from July 31, 2025, and we're now analyzing a championship that extends through the full season (likely ending in November-December 2025). This temporal gap of several months means significant developments could have occurred that aren't reflected in the available data.\\n\\nThe sources include reputable F1 media (Autosport, Planet F1) and direct quotes from Piastri himself, providing high-quality primary information. However, forum discussions (TenTenths, Quora) while insightful, represent opinion rather than verified facts.\\n\\n(2) UNCERTAINTY FACTORS AFFECTING CONFIDENCE\\n\\n• **Remaining races**: With potentially 8-10 races remaining after July, there's substantial opportunity for momentum shifts, mechanical failures, or strategic errors that could alter the championship outcome.\\n\\n• **Norris's capability**: The 16-point gap is relatively small in F1 terms. Norris has proven speed and could capitalize on any Piastri mistakes or reliability issues. The championship battle between teammates adds unpredictability.\\n\\n• **External variables**: Weather conditions, safety car timing, potential regulation changes, or reliability issues could dramatically impact results. The research doesn't provide data on comparative reliability between the McLaren drivers.\\n\\n• **Historical precedent limitations**: While the Brabham/Jones parallel is interesting, it's based on only two data points and may not be statistically significant.\\n\\n(3) CONFIDENCE LEVEL JUSTIFICATION\\n\\nThe 72% confidence reflects:\\n\\n**Supporting factors (increase confidence)**:\\n- Strong current championship position (16-point lead)\\n- Clear car superiority over rivals\\n- Demonstrated performance improvement and consistency\\n- Superior mental composure under pressure\\n- Verstappen effectively eliminated from contention\\n- Positive momentum and recent race wins\\n\\n**Limiting factors (decrease confidence)**:\\n- Significant time gap in available data (July to season end)\\n- Close points battle with capable teammate\\n- Inherent unpredictability of F1 racing\\n- Lack of mechanical reliability data\\n- No information on potential car development trajectories\\n\\nThe confidence level stops short of 80%+ due to the incomplete season data and the inherent volatility of F1 championships, particularly in close teammate battles.\",\n    \"probability\": 68\n  },\n  \"keyFactors\": [\n    \"Current 16-point championship lead over Norris and 81-point lead over Verstappen\",\n    \"McLaren's clear car superiority - described as 'best' on grid with three consecutive 1-2 finishes\",\n    \"Piastri's superior composure and mistake-free driving compared to Norris's error-prone performances\",\n    \"Strong recent form with multiple wins and consistent podiums throughout 2025\",\n    \"Verstappen's decline with only one podium in last six races, effectively eliminating Red Bull from contention\",\n    \"Piastri's rapid development trajectory - found the 'extra tenth' to match/exceed Norris pace\",\n    \"Historical precedent of Australian drivers (Brabham, Jones) winning WDC in years they achieved 5 GP wins\",\n    \"Team dynamics favoring championship leader if gap is maintained\",\n    \"Remaining season length allowing for potential momentum shifts or reliability issues\",\n    \"Mental strength advantage in high-pressure championship battles\"\n  ],\n  \"dataQuality\": \"MEDIUM\",\n  \"lastUpdated\": \"2025-01-27T00:00:00Z\"\n}\n```",

[Share on Viber](viber://forward?text=https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/f1-panel-is-oscar-piastri-now-the-title-favourite/10713615/)\n- Since letting his [McLaren](https://www.autosport.com/team/mclaren/36473/) slide off the track on lap 44 in Melbourne and losing a lot of points, [Oscar Piastri](https://www.autosport.com/driver/oscar-piastri/869530/) has been almost flawless. Two victories, in Shanghai and Bahrain, and a third place in Suzuka allowed him to regain almost everything he lost in the Formula 1 season opener.

Webber was seven points ahead of team-mate [Sebastian Vettel](https://www.autosport.com/driver/sebastian-vettel/829234/) going into the 2010 season finale but Vettel was always Red Bull’s favoured son.

Piastri's impressive performance in 2024, where he consistently contended for wins and finished 4th in the championship, indicates a strong trajectory. His calm demeanor under pressure is seen as an advantage over Norris, who has been prone to mistakes. If Piastri can establish a lead early in the season, McLaren may prioritize his championship bid, making him a serious contender for the title. Overall, the 2025 season is shaping up to be highly competitive, particularly between Piastri and Norris.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- How likely is it that Lando Norris could finish outside the top 2 in the 2025 Drivers' Championship given how well Oscar Piastri is doing? Too early to tell, but certainly possible. Media thought his 2024 blunders would teach him what he needs to do to win the World Championship, but so far in 2025 he seems to be the same old mistake prone Lando. Given that his teammate Piastri is looking rock solid and Max simply doesn’t make mistakes, as long as the RedBull remains decent it’s quite likely Max and Oscar will fight for the gold while Norris is left behind.\n- And of course, being too early we don’t know how much can Mercedes and Ferrari progress. Lewis is not a factor, but Russell and Leclerc could become contenders given the right car. Do you think Oscar Piastri can shift the balance of power McLaren away from Lando Norris? Oscar Piastri could definitely be favoured above Lando Norris, and I think 2025 may be the year we see that transition.\n- What are the chances that Oscar (and McLaren) win the 2025 Formula 1 championship over Max and Lando? The bookies have the odds currently (28th May 2025) as follows; Oscar Piastri 7/5 (41.7%) Lando Norris 13/8 (38.1%) Max Verstappen (23.1%) The figures in brackets are the implied percentage chance for each driver winning the title this season. So yes, Oscar is favourite and rightly so as things stand, Norris second favourite and then Verstappen third, no other driver has a realistic chance of winning the title as things stand.\n\n### Content\nHow likely is it that Lando Norris could finish outside the top 2 in the 2025 Drivers' Championship given how well Oscar Piastri is doing?

Do you think Oscar Piastri can shift the balance of power McLaren away from Lando Norris? Oscar Piastri could definitely be favoured above Lando Norris, and I think 2025 may be the year we see that transition. 2024 was Oscar’s 2nd year in F1, but at almost every race, he was a contender for a win. Admittedly, 2024 was the first year that Lando also had a competitive car, but Piastri’s rate of development in F1 has been incredible. At the end of 2023, Oscar finished 9th in the World Drivers Championship, and in 2024 he finished 4th. When comparing the points between Norris and Piastri, in 2023 Norris bettered Piastri by 108 points, and in 2024 by 82 points; keeping in mind that Oscar let Lando by on a few occasions and that he had a broken rib for the first half of the season. With this rate of progress, 2025 should be a tight battle, but I think Oscar will come out on top. Mainly because he’s a lot more cool headed than Norris is, so I think he will absorb the pressure of fighting for the championship much better than his team mate will. Many, including Sebastian Vettel have tipped him to become the first Australian WDC since Alan Jones in the 1980. The key lies in how he starts the season. If he can draw a decent margin to Lando at th\n\n---\n\n## Source 3: Why Oscar Piastri will win the WDC in 2025 - Page 4\nURL: https://tentenths.com/forum/showthread.php?s=a93b664f41f812815454193e748ae451&p=4257183\nPublished: 2025-06-17T00:00:00.000Z\n\n### Summary\nOscar Piastri is emerging as a strong contender for the 2025 Formula 1 World Drivers' Championship (WDC). As of June 2025, he has matched the achievements of legendary Australian drivers by winning five Grands Prix in a single season, with the potential to become the first Aussie to secure six wins. This historical context suggests a promising trajectory for Piastri, as both Jack Brabham and Alan Jones won the WDC in the years they achieved five wins.\n\nDiscussion among forum members highlights Piastri's remarkable improvement and competitiveness, particularly against his teammate Lando Norris. Initially, some doubted Piastri's ability to outperform Norris, but recent performances indicate he has found the speed needed to be a championship favorite. His consistency and ability to handle pressure have also been noted, with one user praising his mistake-free driving and strong qualifying performances.\n\nOverall, the sentiment in the forum leans towards optimism regarding Piastri's chances of becoming the 2025 Drivers' Champion, especially if he maintains his current form and continues to capitalize on opportunities throughout the season.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Joins Jack Brabham (1960) and Alan Jones (1980) as the only Aussies to win 5 GPs in a season..... one more win this year and he becomes the only Aussie to win 6 GP's in a season. Oh and of course both AJ and JB won the WDC title in the year they got 5 wins, which has to be a decent omen.  Piastri has the potential to be world champion in the right car, but I can’t see it happening while Norris is his teammate.\n- Norris is just that little bit faster than him and while Piastri is still inexperienced and can improve, I can’t see him ever gaining that tenth or so.  This could turn out to be one of my worst F1 takes. I didn’t believe for a second Piastri would ever beat Norris over a season before 2025, but he really has found that extra tenth and is now absolutely the championship favourite.\n- If his qualifying performance hold-up, he is looking very strong.  Oscar is already faster than Lando. And has more wins than Lando in F1 despite a few years less experience. he will win the whole thing next year. make my words. He’s already one of the top 3 drivers on the grid and with McLaren improving it will be a piece of cake. ?  It's too bad that FAS33 couldn't tone himself down and not get the boot from the forum to see his prediction (potentially) come true.\n\n### Content\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1 Jun 2025, 21:03 (Ref:4256767)\n \n \n  \n # 76 \n \n \n \n \n \n Veteran \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n Joins Jack Brabham (1960) and Alan Jones (1980) as the only Aussies to win 5 GPs in a season..... one more win this year and he becomes the only Aussie to win 6 GP's in a season. \nOh and of course both AJ and JB won the WDC title in the year they got 5 wins, which has to be a decent omen.\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2 Jun 2025, 08:53 (Ref:4256799)\n \n \n  \n # 77 \n \n \n \n \n \n Veteran \n \n   \n \n \n  \n Join Date: Nov 2020 \n \n Posts: 1,179\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Quote: \n \n \n Originally Posted by BTCC frog \n \n \n Piastri has the potential to be world champion in the right car, but I can’t see it happening while Norris is his teammate.

With Max Verstappen now 81 points behind and struggling to maintain competitive form, Piastri believes the championship battle will primarily be between him and Norris, given McLaren's dominance this season. Piastri has highlighted his recent performances, including a victory at Spa, and is focused on maintaining consistency to secure his first World Championship.\n\n### Key Highlights\n- **Oscar Piastri admits that the F1 2025 Drivers’ Championship battle is now likely to come down to a straight fight between him and McLaren team-mate Lando Norris. ** With nearest challenger Max Verstappen having fallen 81 points off top spot, championship leader [Piastri](https://www.planetf1.com/driver/oscar-piastri/results) is now looking to McLaren team-mate Norris as his main challenger for the crown as they battle it out in the “best” car on the grid.\n- McLaren has kicked on impressively from their 2024 Constructors’ Championship win to become the clear standard of F1 2025, though for a time reigning four-time World Champion Verstappen was keeping himself in the title hunt at the wheel of the Red Bull RB21. But with just one podium finish in his last six grands prix, Verstappen’s chances have dwindled with McLaren on a run of three consecutive one-two results.\n- Piastri blunted Norris’ momentum with victory at Spa, extending his lead to 16 points, and ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix, he was asked if he now considers this [title fight](https://www.planetf1.com/standings) a two-horse race between the McLaren drivers. “I expect our competition to still be strong and put up a good fight, especially at certain tracks through the rest of the year, but whether that comes from Max or Ferrari or Mercedes or someone else, maybe, we never really know.\n\n### Content\nOscar Piastri admits Max Verstappen is likely out of the title race\n\n**Oscar Piastri admits that the F1 2025 Drivers’ Championship battle is now likely to come down to a straight fight between him and McLaren team-mate Lando Norris.**\n\nWith nearest challenger Max Verstappen having fallen 81 points off top spot, championship leader [Piastri](https://www.planetf1.com/driver/oscar-piastri/results) is now looking to McLaren team-mate Norris as his main challenger for the crown as they battle it out in the “best” car on the grid.\n\n## Max Verstappen out of F1 2025 title running?\n\n_Additional reporting by Thomas Maher_\n\nMcLaren has kicked on impressively from their 2024 Constructors’ Championship win to become the clear standard of F1 2025, though for a time reigning four-time World Champion Verstappen was keeping himself in the title hunt at the wheel of the Red Bull RB21.\n\nBut with just one podium finish in his last six grands prix, Verstappen’s chances have dwindled with McLaren on a run of three consecutive one-two results.\n\nPiastri blunted Norris’ momentum with victory at Spa, extending his lead to 16 points, and ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix, he was asked if he now considers this [title fight](https://www.planetf1.com/standings) a two-horse race between the McLaren drivers.\n\n“I suppose so,” he confirmed.\n\n“I think every weekend now, or the last few weekends anyway, it’s been Lando and I.\n\n“I expect our competition to still be strong and put up a good fight, especially at certain tracks through the rest of the year, but whether that comes from Max or Ferrari or Mercedes or someone else, maybe, we never really know.\n\n“So, I’m not too concerned about what happens in that. I’m just trying to win each race and extend the lead.\n\n“But I think clearly Lando and I are in the same car, which is the best, and he’s naturally going to be the closest competition.”\n\n## Oscar Piastri vs Lando Norris head-to-head in F1 2025\n\n👉 [F1 2025: Head-to-head qualifying statistics between"
